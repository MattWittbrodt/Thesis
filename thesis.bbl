    \field{abstract}{%
    Human neuropsychology investigates brain-behavior relationships, using
  objective tools (neurological tests) to tie the biological and behavior
  aspects together. The use of neuropsychological assessment tools in assessing
  potential effects of dehydration is a natural progression of the scientific
  pursuit to understand the physical and mental ramifications of dehydration.
  It has long been known that dehydration negatively affects physical
  performance. Examining the effects of hydration status on cognitive function
  is a relatively new area of research, resulting in part from our increased
  understanding of hydration's impact on physical performance and advances in
  the discipline of cognitive neuropsychology. The available research in this
  area, albeit sparse, indicates that decrements in physical, visuomotor,
  psychomotor, and cognitive performance can occur when 2\% or more of body
  weight is lost due to water restriction, heat, and/or physical exertion.
  Additional research is needed, especially studies designed to reduce, if not
  remove, the limitations of studies conducted to date.%

    Although it is well known that water is essential for human homeostasis and
  survival, only recently have we begun to understand its role in the
  maintenance of brain function. Herein, we integrate emerging evidence
  regarding the effects of both dehydration and additional acute water
  consumption on cognition and mood. Current findings in the field suggest that
  particular cognitive abilities and mood states are positively influenced by
  water consumption. The impact of dehydration on cognition and mood is
  particularly relevant for those with poor fluid regulation, such as the
  elderly and children. We critically review the most recent advances in both
  behavioural and neuroimaging studies of dehydration and link the findings to
  the known effects of water on hormonal, neurochemical and vascular functions
  in an attempt to suggest plausible mechanisms of action. We identify some
  methodological weaknesses, including inconsistent measurements in cognitive
  assessment and the lack of objective hydration state measurements as well as
  gaps in knowledge concerning mediating factors that may influence water
  intervention effects. Finally, we discuss how future research can best
  elucidate the role of water in the optimal maintenance of brain health and
  function.%

    Dehydration is a reliable predictor of impaired cognitive status. Objective
  data, using tests of cortical function, support the deterioration of mental
  performance in mildly dehydrated younger adults. Dehydration frequently
  results in delirium as a manifestation of cognitive dysfunction. Although,
  the occurrence of delirium suggests transient acute global cerebral
  dysfunction, cognitive impairment may not be completely reversible. Animal
  studies have identified neuronal mitochondrial damage and glutamate
  hypertransmission in dehydrated rats. Additional studies have identified an
  increase in cerebral nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase
  activity (nitric oxide synthase, NOS) with dehydration. Available evidence
  also implicates NOS as a neurotransmitter in long-term potentiation,
  rendering this a critical enzyme in facilitating learning and memory. With
  ageing, a reduction of NOS activity has been identified in the cortex and
  striatum of rats. The reduction of NOs synthase activity that occurs with
  ageing may blunt the rise that occurs with dehydration, and possibly
  interfere with memory processing and cognitive function. Dehydration has been
  shown to be a reliable predictor of increasing frailty, deteriorating mental
  performance and poor quality of life. Intervention models directed toward
  improving outcomes in dehydration must incorporate strategies to enhance
  prompt recognition of cognitive dysfunction.%

    The effect of primary dehydration of various levels (1, 2 and 3\%
  body-weight deficits) on mental functions of different complexities were
  studied in eight heat-acclimatized subjects drawn from tropical regions of
  India. These subjects were also studied after a bout of exercise in heat
  under two conditions viz., Hot Dry (45°C DB, 30\% rh), and Hot Humid (39DC
  DB, 60\% rh) at 34°C WBGT. No significant change in routine mental work was
  seen either under dehydration per se of any level or after subsequent
  exercise under heat when compared with the normal state. On the other hand,
  at 2 and 3\% levels of primary dehydration a further reduction was noted in
  all the functions though it was not significant. Inter-variations in Hot
  Humid and Hot Dry conditions were not significant except for more pronounced
  reductions in the concentration component in Hot Humid conditions.%

    Body water deficits or hypohydration (HYP) may degrade cognitive
  performance during heat exposure and perhaps temperate conditions. Cold
  exposure often induces HYP, but the combined effects of cold and HYP on
  cognitive performance are unknown. This study investigated whether HYP
  degrades cognitive performance during cold exposure and if physical exercise
  could mitigate any cold-induced performance decline. On four occasions, eight
  volunteers completed one hour of militarily-relevant cognitive testing: 30
  min of simulated sentry duty/marksmanship, 20 min of a visual vigilance task,
  a self-report workload assessment, and a mood questionnaire. Testing was
  conducted in a cold (2 degrees C) or temperate (20 degrees C) environment
  before and after cycle ergometer (60 min at 60\% of VO(2peak)) exercise. Each
  trial was preceded by 3 h of passive heat stress (45 degrees C) in the early
  morning with (euhydration, EUH) or without (hypohydration, HYP; 3\% body
  mass) fluid replacement followed by prolonged recovery. HYP did not alter any
  cognitive, psychomotor, or self-report parameter in either environment before
  or after exercise. Cold exposure increased (p{\textless}0.05) target
  detection latency in the sentry duty task, adversely affected mood and
  workload ratings, but had no impact on any other cognitive or psychomotor
  measure. After completing the exercise bout, there were modest improvements
  in friend-foe discrimination and total response latency in the sentry duty
  task, but not on any other performance measures. Moderate HYP had no effect
  on cognitive and psychomotor performance in either environment, cold exposure
  produced equivocal effects, and aerobic exercise improved some aspects of
  military task performance.;%

    Equivocal findings have been reported in the few studies that examined the
  impact of ambient temperature (T a) and hypohydration on cognition and
  dynamic balance. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of
  acute exposure to a range of ambient temperatures (T(a) 10-40 °C) in
  euhydration (EUH) and hypohydration (HYP) states on cognition, mood and
  dynamic balance. Thirty-two men (age 22 ± 4 years, height 1.80 ± 0.05 m,
  body mass 85.4 ± 10.8 kg) were grouped into four matched cohorts (n = 8),
  and tested in one of the four T(a) (10, 20, 30, 40 °C) when EUH and HYP (-4
  \% body mass via exercise-heat exposure). Cognition was assessed using
  psychomotor vigilance, 4-choice reaction time, matching to sample, and
  grammatical reasoning. Mood was evaluated by profile of mood states and
  dynamic postural balance was tested using a Biodex Balance System. Thermal
  sensation (TS), core (T core) and skin temperature (T(sk)) were obtained
  throughout testing. Volunteers lost -4.1 ± 0.4 \% body mass during HYP. T sk
  and TS increased with increasing T(a), with no effect of hydration. Cognitive
  performance was not altered by HYP or thermal stress. Total mood disturbance
  (TMD), fatigue, confusion, anger, and depression increased during HYP at all
  T(a). Dynamic balance was unaffected by HYP, but 10 °C exposure impaired
  balance compared to all other T(a). Despite an increase in TMD during HYP,
  cognitive function was maintained in all testing environments, demonstrating
  cognitive resiliency in response to body fluid deficits. Dynamic postural
  stability at 10 °C appeared to be hampered by low-grade shivering, but was
  otherwise maintained during HYP and thermal stress.;%

    Studying the effects of dehydration on cognitive function presents a
  variety of unique and difficult challenges to investigators. These
  challenges, which are addressed in this article, can be divided into three
  general categories: 1) choosing an appropriate method of generating a
  consistent level of dehydration; 2) determining and effectively employing
  appropriate and sensitive measures of cognitive state; and 3) adequately
  controlling the many confounding factors that interfere with assessment of
  cognitive function. The design and conduct of studies on the effects of
  dehydration on cognitive function should carefully consider various
  methodological issues, and investigators should carefully weigh the benefits
  and disadvantages of particular methods and procedures.%

    BACKGROUND: Military exercises generate high levels of stress to simulate
  combat, providing a unique opportunity to examine cognitive and physiologic
  responses of normal humans to acute stress. METHODS: Cognitive and
  physiologic markers of stress were evaluated before, during, and after an
  intense training exercise conducted for 53 hours in the heat. Cognitive
  performance, mood, physical activity, sleep, body composition, hydration, and
  saliva cortisol, testosterone, and melatonin were assessed. Volunteers were
  31 male U.S. Army officers from an elite unit, aged 31.6 +/- .4 years.
  RESULTS: Wrist activity monitors documented that soldiers slept only 3.0 +/-
  .3 hours during the exercise and were active throughout. Volunteers lost 4.1
  +/- .2 kg (p {\textless} .001) of weight, predominately water (3.1 +/- .3 L)
  (p {\textless} .001). Substantial degradation in cognitive function, assessed
  with computerized tests, occurred. Vigilance, reaction time, attention,
  memory, and reasoning were impaired (p {\textless} .001). Mood, including
  vigor (p {\textless} .001), fatigue (p {\textless} .001), confusion (p
  {\textless} .001), depression (p {\textless} .001), and tension (p
  {\textless} .002), assessed by questionnaire, deteriorated. The highest
  cortisol and testosterone levels were observed before the exercise.
  CONCLUSIONS: This study quantifies the overwhelmingly adverse impact of
  multiple stressors on cognitive performance, mood, and physiologic
  parameters, during a continuous but brief military exercise conducted by
  highly motivated, well-trained officers.%

    How does a lack of sleep affect our brains? In contrast to the benefits of
  sleep, frameworks exploring the impact of sleep loss are relatively lacking.
  Importantly, the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) do not simply reflect the
  absence of sleep and the benefits attributed to it; rather, they reflect the
  consequences of several additional factors, including extended wakefulness.
  With a focus on neuroimaging studies, we review the consequences of SD on
  attention and working memory, positive and negative emotion, and hippocampal
  learning. We explore how this evidence informs our mechanistic understanding
  of the known changes in cognition and emotion associated with SD, and the
  insights it provides regarding clinical conditions associated with sleep
  disruption.%

    Acute hypoglycemia impairs functions of the central nervous system, but few
  controlled studies have assessed the impact of hypoglycemia on the function
  of the peripheral nervous system. Sixteen non-diabetic humans underwent two
  separate hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp procedures on different study days,
  in a counter-balanced fashion. On one occasion, euglycemia was maintained
  (blood glucose, 5.0 mmol l(-1)), and on the other occasion, hypoglycemia
  (blood glucose, 2.6 mmol l(-1)) was induced. During each condition, subjects
  performed a combined psychometric, cognitive-experimental and psychophysical
  test battery, and measures were made (in the dominant median and common
  peroneal nerves) of the motor nerve conduction velocities and the amplitudes
  of the motor action potentials. Hypoglycemia caused impaired performance of
  general cognitive and information processing tasks (P{\textless}.05), but
  nerve conduction velocities and the amplitudes of motor action potentials
  were unaffected. Conduction velocities of the common peroneal nerve decreased
  from baseline within each experimental condition, perhaps due to
  hyperinsulinemia. Overall, these results demonstrate that multiple levels of
  information processing in the brain may alter while peripheral nerve function
  remains intact, and imply that peripheral neurons do not have the same
  obligate requirement for glucose as a metabolic fuel as neurons of the
  central nervous system.%

    There were 44 young men who participated in strenuous combat courses of 4 d

  examined clinically each morning. Groups 1 and 2 had no organized sleep,
  whereas groups 3 and 4 got 3 and 6 h, respectively, in the middle of each
  course. Substantial impairment was observed in all tests, as well as clinical
  symptoms toward the end of the courses for groups 1 and 2. In the vigilance
  test, the reaction time task, the code test, and the profile of mood-state,
  significant impairment was observed even after 24 h. Complaints of symptoms
  came first. Disturbance of senses and behaviour appeared later. Group 4 had
  significantly better results than groups 1 and 2 in clinical symptoms and all
  tests, except the positive score in mood-state. Group 3 occupied an
  intermediate position. Corresponding results were obtained in the two

    Twenty five subjects acclimatised to heat artificially were exposed to
  "basic effective temperatures" (BET) of 25.0 degrees, 29.6 degrees, 32.2
  degrees, 33.3 degrees and 35.0 degrees C BET under conditions of both humid
  and dry heat. The object of the investigation was to ascertain the nature of
  effects of varying degrees of heat stress on mental alertness, associative
  learning, reasoning ability and dual-performance efficiency. A further aim
  was to determine the temperature levels at which impairment of psychological
  functions was severe enough to be of practical concern. The duration of each
  exposure was four hours, during which subjects performed physical exercise
  followed by rest every 30 min. It was found that all the psychological
  functions tested were adversely affected under extreme heat, and that a
  significant drop in various psychological functions was seen at effective
  temperatures of 32.2 degrees C and 33.3 degrees C in hot-humid and hot-dry
  conditions respectively. It is concluded that at the same effective
  temperatures the magnitude of the overall effect on psychological functions
  under humid conditions is relatively greater than that under dry conditions.%

  water (intracellular dehydration) and an iso-osmotic loss of body water
  (extracellular dehydration) is presented and argued as the single most
  essential aspect of dehydration assessment. The importance of diagnostic and
  biological variation analyses to dehydration assessment methods is reviewed
  and their use in gauging the true potential of any dehydration assessment
  method highlighted. The necessity for establishing proper baselines is
  discussed, as is the magnitude of dehydration required to elicit reliable and
  detectable osmotic or volume-mediated compensatory physiologic responses. The
  discussion of physiologic responses further helps inform and explain our
  analysis of the literature suggesting a {\textgreater}/= 2\% dehydration
  threshold for impaired endurance exercise performance mediated by volume
  loss. In contrast, no clear threshold or plausible mechanism(s) support the
  marginal, but potentially important, impairment in strength, and power
  observed with dehydration. Similarly, the potential for dehydration to impair
  cognition appears small and related primarily to distraction or discomfort.
  The impact of dehydration on any particular sport skill or task is therefore
  likely dependent upon the makeup of the task itself (e.g., endurance,
  strength, cognitive, and motor skill).%

    The primary aims of this paper were to examine the effect of heat stress on
  working memory, choice reaction time and mood state, and to investigate the
  relationship between heat induced changes in plasma concentrations of
  selected neurotransmitters and hormones, and cognition. Heat stress resulted
  in a deterioration of performance on a central executive task (random
  movement generation) but not on verbal and spatial recall, and choice
  reaction time tasks. Perceptions of vigour decreased and fatigue increased
  following exposure to heat stress. Plasma concentrations of cortisol and
  5-hydroxytryptamine significantly increased following exposure to heat.
  Regression analyses showed that percent body mass loss and change from
  baseline (Δ) concentrations of cortisol, post-exposure to heat, were
  significant predictors of Δ random movement generation and Δ fatigue. A
  secondary purpose was to examine the effect of recovery on cognition and
  mood. Following recovery, the performance of the central executive task was
  poorer than pre-treatment. Mood states, catecholamines and
  5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations returned to pre-treatment values, but
  cortisol fell to a level significantly lower. Regression correlations showed
  that Δ adrenaline and Δ scores, post-recovery, on the central executive
  task were significantly correlated. Δ noradrenaline correlated significantly
  with Δ fatigue. It was concluded that heat stress results in deterioration
  in the performance of central executive tasks and perceptions of mood state,
  and that this can be predicted by changes in body mass loss and plasma
  concentrations of the hormones cortisol and adrenaline.%

    This paper discusses the current state of knowledge on the effects of heat
  stress on cognitive performance. Although substantial research has been
  performed, it has proven difficult to describe the literature findings in a
  systematic manner. This is due to the large number of factors that come into
  play, such as task type, exposure duration, skill and acclimatization level
  of the individual and due to the absence of a concise theory on which
  experimental work can be based. However, two trends have been identified.
  First, heat stress affects cognitive performance differentially, depending on
  the type of cognitive task. Secondly, it appears that a relationship can be
  established between the effects of heat stress and deep body temperature. A
  number of exposure limits have been proposed during the last decades. These
  limits are summarized in this paper, with a special emphasis on the most
  recent one derived by Hancock and Vasmatzidis. This limit, which employs an
  attentional resource approach, defines exposure duration thresholds as
  parallel lines. Although this approach appears to be the most promising thus
  far, it is concluded that much remains to be understood before a limit
  becomes universally acceptable.%

    Although it has been suggested that many in the general population are
  dehydrated to the extent that mood and cognition are disrupted, there has
  been little research investigating mild levels of dehydration. When
  dehydration reduces body mass by more than 2\%, it has been consistently
  reported that mood is influenced, fatigue is greater, and alertness is lower.
  In contrast, the effects on cognition have been less consistent. Only a few
  studies have looked at females and these studies made little attempt to
  consider hormones that influence kidney functioning. In particular, there has
  been virtually no attempt to look at changes in hydration status in the range
  that occurs in individuals with a sedentary lifestyle in a temperate climate.
  There is a consequent need to study individuals who have lost up to 1\% of
  body mass due to dehydration. While 4 intervention trials have found that the
  cognition of children improved in response to water consumption, the effects
  of water consumption on cognition in older adults, another high-risk group,
  have been largely ignored.%

    Dehydration (body water deficit) is a physiologic state that can have
  profound implications for human health and performance. Unfortunately,
  dehydration can be difficult to assess, and there is no single, universal
  gold standard for decision making. In this article, we review the physiologic
  basis for understanding quantitative dehydration assessment. We highlight how
  phenomenologic interpretations of dehydration depend critically on the type
  (dehydration compared with volume depletion) and magnitude (moderate compared
  with severe) of dehydration, which in turn influence the osmotic (plasma
  osmolality) and blood volume-dependent compensatory thresholds for
  antidiuretic and thirst responses. In particular, we review new findings
  regarding the biological variation in osmotic responses to dehydration and
  discuss how this variation can help provide a quantitative and clinically
  relevant link between the physiology and phenomenology of dehydration.
  Practical measures with empirical thresholds are provided as a starting point
  for improving the practice of dehydration assessment.%

    Purpose: The impact of mild hypohydration on physiological responses and
  cognitive performance following exercise-heat stress (EHS) were examined
  compared with conditions when fluids were ingested ad libitum (AL) or
  replaced to match sweat losses (FR). Methods: Twelve unacclimatized,
  recreationally-active men (22.2 +/- 2.4 y) completed 50 min cycling
  (60\%VO2peak) in the heat (32 degrees C; 65\% RH) under three conditions: no
  fluid (NF), AL, and FR. Before and after EHS, a cognitive battery was
  completed: Trail making, perceptual vigilance, pattern comparison,
  match-to-sample, and letter-digit recognition tests. Results: Hypohydration
  during NF was greater compared with AL and FR (NF: -1.5 +/- 0.6; AL: -0.3 +/-
  0.8; FR: -0.1 +/- 0.3\% body mass loss) resulting in higher core temperature
  (by 0.4, 0.5 degrees C), heart rate (by 13 and 15 b.min(-1)), and
  physiological strain (by 1.3, 1.5) at the end of EHS compared with AL and FR,
  respectively. Cognitive performance (response time and accuracy) was not
  altered by fluid condition; however, mean response time improved (p
  {\textless} .05) for letter-digit recognition (by 56.7 +/- 85.8 ms or 3.8\%;
  p {\textless} .05) and pattern comparison (by 80.6 +/- 57.4 ms or 7.1\%; p
  {\textless} .001), but mean accuracy decreased in trail making (by 1.2 +/-
  1.4\%; p = .01) after EHS (across all conditions). Conclusions: For
  recreational athletes, fluid intake effectively mitigated physiological
  strain induced by mild hypohydration; however, mild hypohydration resulting
  from EHS elicited no adverse changes in cognitive performance.%

  volume of fluid in line with published guidelines (HYD trial) or 25\% of this
  intake (FR trial) in a crossover manner. Participants came to the laboratory
  the following morning after an overnight fast. One hour following a standard
  breakfast, a 120min driving simulation task began. Driver errors, including
  instances of lane drifting or late breaking, EEG and heart rate were recorded
  throughout the driving task RESULTS: Pre-trial body mass (P=0.692), urine
  osmolality (P=0.838) and serum osmolality (P=0.574) were the same on both
  trials. FR resulted in a 1.1+/-0.7\% reduction in body mass, compared to
  -0.1+/-0.6\% in the HYD trial (P=0.002). Urine and serum osmolality were both
  increased following FR (P{\textless}0.05). There was a progressive increase
  in the total number of driver errors observed during both the HYD and FR
  trials, but significantly more incidents were recorded throughout the FR
  trial (HYD 47+/-44, FR 101+/-84; ES=0.81; P=0.006) CONCLUSIONS: The results
  of the present study suggest that mild hypohydration, produced a significant
  increase in minor driving errors during a prolonged, monotonous drive,
  compared to that observed while performing the same task in a hydrated
  condition. The magnitude of decrement reported, was similar to that observed
  following the ingestion of an alcoholic beverage resulting in a blood alcohol
  content of approximately 0.08\% (the current UK legal driving limit), or
  while sleep deprived.%

    Previous research has shown that treating dependent effect sizes as
  independent inflates the variance of the mean effect size and introduces bias
  by giving studies with more effect sizes more weight in the meta-analysis.
  This article summarizes the different approaches to handling dependence that
  have been advocated by methodologists, some of which are more feasible to
  implement with education research studies than others. A case study using
  effect sizes from a recent meta-analysis of reading interventions is
  presented to compare the results obtained from different approaches to
  dealing with dependence. Overall, mean effect sizes and variance estimates
  were found to be similar, but estimates of indexes of heterogeneity varied.
  Meta-analysts are advised to explore the effect of the method of handling
  dependence on the heterogeneity estimates before conducting moderator
  analyses and to choose the approach to dependence that is best suited to
  their research question and their data set.%

    Conventional meta-analytic techniques rely on the assumption that effect
  size estimates from different studies are independent and have sampling
  distributions with known conditional variances. The independence assumption
  is violated when studies produce several estimates based on the same
  individuals or there are clusters of studies that are not independent (such
  as those carried out by the same investigator or laboratory). This paper
  provides an estimator of the covariance matrix of meta-regression
  coefficients that are applicable when there are clusters of internally
  correlated estimates. It makes no assumptions about the specific form of the
  sampling distributions of the effect sizes, nor does it require knowledge of
  the covariance structure of the dependent estimates. Moreover, this paper
  demonstrates that the meta-regression coefficients are consistent and
  asymptotically normally distributed and that the robust variance estimator is
  valid even when the covariates are random. The theory is asymptotic in the
  number of studies, but simulations suggest that the theory may yield accurate
  results with as few as 20-40 studies. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons,

    Although primary studies often report multiple outcomes, the covariances
  between these outcomes are rarely reported. This leads to difficulties when
  combining studies in a meta-analysis. This problem was recently addressed
  with the introduction of robust variance estimation. This new method enables
  the estimation of meta-regression models with dependent effect sizes, even
  when the dependence structure is unknown. Although robust variance estimation
  has been shown to perform well when the number of studies in the
  meta-analysis is large, previous simulation studies suggest that the
  associated tests often have Type I error rates that are much larger than
  nominal. In this article, I introduce 6 estimators with better small sample
  properties and study the effectiveness of these estimators via 2 simulation
  studies. The results of these simulations suggest that the best estimator
  involves correcting both the residuals and degrees of freedom used in the
  robust variance estimator. These studies also suggest that the degrees of
  freedom depend on not only the number of studies but also the type of
  covariates in the meta-regression. The fact that the degrees of freedom can
  be small, even when the number of studies is large, suggests that these
  small-sample corrections should be used more generally. I conclude with an
  example comparing the results of a meta-regression with robust variance
  estimation with the results from the corrected estimator.%

    Methodologists have recently proposed robust variance estimation as one way
  to handle dependent effect sizes in meta-analysis. Software macros for robust
  variance estimation in meta-analysis are currently available for Stata
  (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) and spss (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA), yet
  there is little guidance for authors regarding the practical application and
  implementation of those macros. This paper provides a brief tutorial on the

  meta-analysts should consider when estimating meta-regression models with

    The effects of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid ingestion on men's
  cognitive performance were assessed. Eleven young men attended separate
  sessions in which each individual cycled in a controlled environment at 60\%

  120 min with fluid replacement. Immediately following the assigned submaximal
  exercise period, the participant completed a graded exercise test to
  voluntary exhaustion. An executive processing test and a short-term memory
  test were performed prior to and immediately following exercise.
  Choice-response times during the executive processing test decreased
  following exercise, regardless of the level of dehydration. Choice-response
  errors increased following exercise, but only on trials requiring set
  shifting. Short-term memory performance improved following exercise,
  regardless of the level of dehydration. Changes in cognitive performance
  following exercise are hypothesized to be related to metabolic arousal

    The hormone cortisol is often believed to play a pivotal role in the
  effects of stress on human cognition. This meta-analysis is an attempt to
  determine the effects of acute cortisol administration on core executive
  functions. Drawing on both rodent and stress literatures, we hypothesized
  that acute cortisol administration would impair working memory and
  set-shifting but enhance inhibition. Additionally, because cortisol is
  thought to exert different nongenomic (rapid) and genomic (slow) effects, we
  further hypothesized that the effects of cortisol would differ as a function
  of the delay between cortisol administration and cognitive testing. Although
  the overall analyses were nonsignificant, after separating the rapid,
  nongenomic effects of cortisol from the slower, genomic effects of cortisol,
  the rapid effects of cortisol enhanced response inhibition, g+ = 0.113,
  p=.016, but impaired working memory, g+ = -0.315, p=.008, although these
  effects reversed over time. Contrary to our hypotheses, there was no effect
  of cortisol administration on set-shifting. Thus, although we did not find
  support for the idea that increases in cortisol influence set-shifting, we
  found that acute increases in cortisol exert differential effects on working
  memory and inhibition over time.%

    Context: Dehydration and concussion are common in athletic performance.
  Some experts have speculated that dehydration may negatively influence
  performance on tests commonly used for concussion assessment. Objective: To
  determine how the signs and symptoms, neuropsychological performance, and
  postural stability are affected by dehydration. Design: Repeated-measures
  design assessing subjects in the euhydrated and dehydrated conditions.
  Setting: Sports Medicine Research Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants:
  Twenty-four healthy, male recreational athletes participated in the study.
  Intervention(s): Subjects participated in 2 counterbalanced sessions
  (euhydrated and dehydrated) separated by at least 7 days. Subjects were
  dehydrated using fluid restriction and an exercise task. No direct
  intervention was provided for the euhydrated condition. Main Outcome
  Measure(s): We used the Standardized Assessment of Concussion to test mental
  status, the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) to
  evaluate neuropsychological performance, the NeuroCom Sensory Organization
  Test and Balance Error Scoring System to test postural stability, the Graded
  Symptom Checklist to assess symptom presence and severity in our
  participants, and urine specific gravity and body mass to determine hydration
  status. Results: No differences were noted for the Standardized Assessment of
  Concussion, total Balance Error Scoring System errors, composite Sensory
  Organization Test, and composite ANAM scores between conditions. Subjects in
  the dehydrated condition had significant deterioration in visual memory
  (t₂₃ = 2.130, P {\textless} .001) and fatigue measures (t₂₃ = -7.880,
  P {\textless} .001) as assessed by ANAM. The dehydrated condition resulted in
  subjects reporting a significantly higher number (t₂₃ = -8.585, P
  {\textless} .001) and severity (t₂₃ = -7.673, P {\textless} .001) of
  symptoms than the euhydrated subjects on the Graded Symptom Checklist.
  Conclusions: Our results suggest that moderate dehydration (-2.5 ± 0.63\%)
  significantly influenced the self-report of symptoms commonly associated with
  concussion. Dehydration resulted in a deterioration of visual memory and
  increases in the self-report of fatigue. Despite these findings, dehydration
  did not affect other neuropsychological and postural stability objective
  testing measures for concussion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all

    Eight healthy men, unacclimated to heat, were submitted to variations in
  body hydration. The subjects were kept euhydrated, dehydrated by controlled
  passive hyperthermia or exercise on a treadmill up to a weight loss of 2.8\%,
  or hyperhydrated using a solution containing glycerol, with a total ingested
  volume equal to 21.4 ml/kg of body weight. On completion of a 90-min recovery
  period, the subjects were assigned a pedaling exercise on an arm-crank
  ergometer. Psychological tests were administered 30 min after the phase of
  hydration variation and 15 min after the arm crank exercise. Both dehydration
  conditions impaired cognitive abilities (i.e., perceptive discrimination,
  psycho-motor skills, and short-term memory) as well as subjective estimates
  of fatigue, without any relevant differences between them. Short-term memory
  was significantly greater following hyperhydration when compared to
  euhydration (P {\textless} .05). Following arm crank exercise, further
  effects of dehydration were found for tracking performance only (P
  {\textless} .05). Moreover, long-term memory was impaired in both control and
  dehydration situations, whereas there was no decrement in performance in the
  hyperhydration condition.%

    The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of
  carbohydrate-electrolyte solution (CE), lemon tea (LT), and distilled water
  (DW) on rehydration and cognitive performance after 60 min of moderate

  randomized crossover study design. During the 4-h recovery (REC) period, they
  consumed either a volume of CE, LT or DW equal to 150\% of their body mass
  (BM) loss during the previous run. The 3 beverages vary in carbohydrate and
  electrolyte content. A battery of cognitive tests was performed upon arrival,
  immediately after exercise, and at the end of REC. After the REC, the
  restoration of BM loss was lower in the DW and LT trials than that in the CE
  trial in the female participants (CE vs. LT vs. DW: 59.3±2.8 vs. 41.7±5.7
  vs. 45.6±2.2\%). When compared with the DW, the accuracy of performances
  during a working memory task in both males and females was higher in the CE
  and LT trials. The results suggested that during a short-term recovery, both
  LT and CE show certain beneficial effect in maintaining cognitive
  performance. However, CE appears to be more effective than LT and DW in
  rehydrating female participants.%

    Context: The effects of dehydration induced by wrestling-related
  weight-cutting tactics on clinical concussion outcomes, such as
  neurocognitive function, balance performance, and symptoms, have not been
  adequately studied. Objective: To evaluate the effects of dehydration on the
  outcome of clinical concussion measures in National Collegiate Athletic
  Association Division I collegiate wrestlers. Design: Repeated-measures
  design. Setting: Clinical research laboratory. Patients or Other
  Participants: Thirty-two Division I healthy collegiate male wrestlers (age =
  20.0 ± 1.4 years; height = 175.0 ±6 7.5 cm; baseline mass = 79.2 ± 12.6
  kg). Intervention(s): Participants completed preseason concussion baseline
  testing in early September. Weight and urine samples were also collected at
  this time. All participants reported to prewrestling practice and
  postwrestling practice for the same test battery and protocol in mid-October.
  They had begun practicing weight-cutting tactics a day before prepractice and
  postpractice testing. Differences between these measures permitted us to
  evaluate how dehydration and weight-cutting tactics affected concussion
  measures. Main Outcome Measures: Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 2 (SCAT2),
  Balance Error Scoring System, Graded Symptom Checklist, and Simple Reaction
  Time scores. The Simple Reaction Time was measured using the Automated
  Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics. Results: The SCAT2 measurements were
  lower at prepractice (P = .002) and postpractice (P {\textless} .001) when
  compared with baseline. The BESS error scores were higher at postpractice
  when compared with baseline (P = .015). The GSC severity scores were higher
  at prepractice (P = .011) and postpractice (P {\textless} .001) than at
  baseline and at postpractice when than at prepractice (P = .003). The number
  of Graded Symptom Checklist symptoms reported was also higher at prepractice
  (P = .036) and postpractice (P {\textless} .001) when compared with baseline,
  and at postpractice when compared with prepractice (P = .003). Conclusions:
  Our results suggest that it is important for wrestlers to be evaluated in a
  euhydrated state to ensure that dehydration is not influencing the outcome of
  the clinical measures.%

    When performing physical work, sweat output often exceeds water intake,
  producing a body water deficit or dehydration. Specific to the work place,
  dehydration can adversely affect worker productivity, safety, and morale.
  Legislative bodies in North America such as the Occupational Safety and
  Health Administration (OSHA) and the American Conference of Governmental
  Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) recommend replacing fluids frequently when
  exposed to heat stress, such as one cup (250 ml) every 20 minutes when
  working in warm environments. However, the majority of legislative guidelines
  provide vague guidance and none take into account the effects of work
  intensity, specific environments, or protective clothing. Improved

    The purpose of the present study was to examine the influence of submaximal
  aerobic exercise duration on simple and complex cognitive performance. Eight
  well-trained male subjects agreed to participate in this study (trial group).
  A control group of eight regularly trained male subjects was included for
  comparative purposes. For the trial group, the experiment involved a critical
  flicker fusion test (CFF) and a map recognition task performed before, every
  20 min during, and immediately after, a 3-h cycling task at an intensity
  corresponding to approximately 60 \% of VO2max. Data were obtained over two
  experimental sessions with fluid ingestion (F) or no fluid (NF) ingestion.
  For the control group the experiment was the same but without exercise and
  fluid ingestion. In the trial group, a significant effect of hydration status
  was observed on physiological parameters (p {\textless}0.05). No effect was
  found on cognitive performance. A significant decrease in CFF performance was
  observed after 120 min of exercise when compared with the first 20 min
  (respectively for CFFmdi: 2.6 vs. 3.8 Hz), irrespective of experimental
  condition. A significant improvement in speed of response (respectively: 3291
  vs. 3062 msec for 20 and 120 min, respectively) and a decrease in error
  number (21.5 \% vs. 6.0 \% for 20 and 120 min, respectively) during the map
  recognition task were recorded between 80 min and 120 min when compared with
  the first 20 min of exercise. After 120 min the number of recorded errors was
  significantly greater indicating a shift in the accuracy-speed trade-off (6.0
  \% vs. 14.1 \% for 120 and 180 min, respectively). These results provide some
  evidence for exercise-induced facilitation of cognitive function. However
  this positive effect disappears during prolonged exercise--as evidenced
  within our study by an increase in errors during the complex task and an
  alteration in perceptual response (i.e. the appearance of symptoms of central
  fatigue).;%

    PURPOSE: Many researchers have addressed the potential effects of
  hyperthermia and dehydration on cognition, often revealing contradictory
  outcomes. A possible reason for this inconsistency is that experiments may
  have been inadequately designed for such effects. In this study, the impact
  of hyperthermia, dehydration and their combination on cognition were
  evaluated in eight young males, after accounting for a range of experimental
  limitations. METHODS: Passive heating and thermal clamping at two mean body
  temperatures (36.5, 38.5 °C) were performed under three hydration states
  (euhydrated, 3 and 5\% dehydrated) to assess their effects on
  difficulty-matched working memory and visual perception tasks, and on a
  difficulty manipulated perceptual task. Data were analysed according to
  signal detection theory to isolate changes in response sensitivity, bias and
  speed. RESULTS: Neither moderate hyperthermia (P = 0.141) nor dehydration
  (P {\textgreater} 0.604) modified response sensitivity, nor did they
  significantly interact (P {\textgreater} 0.698). Therefore, the ability
  to distinguish correct from incorrect responses was unaffected. Nevertheless,
  hyperthermia, but not dehydration (P = 0.301), reduced the response bias
  (-0.08 versus 2.2 [normothermia]; P = 0.010) and reaction time (mean
  reduction 49 ms; P {\textless} 0.001), eliciting more liberal and faster
  responses (P = 0.010). Response bias was reduced for the memory relative
  to the perceptual task (P = 0.037), and this effect was enhanced during
  hyperthermia (P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: These observations imply that,
  once potentially confounding influences were controlled, moderate
  hyperthermia, significant dehydration and their combined effects had
  insufficient impact to impair cognition within the memory and perceptual
  domains tested. Nonetheless, moderate hyperthermia elicited more liberal and
  rapid responses.%

    We investigated the cognitive effects of exercising in the heat on the
  field players of two football teams in a series of three matches. Different
  rehydration and cooling strategies were used for one of the teams during the
  last two games. Cognitive functions were measured before, during and
  immediately after each football match, as well as core temperature, body
  mass, plasma osmolality and glucose levels, allowing an estimate of their
  differential impacts on cognition. The pattern of results suggests that
  mild-moderate dehydration during exercise in the heat (up to 2.5\%) has no
  clear effect on cognitive function. Instead, plasma glucose and core
  temperature changes appear to be the main determinants: higher glucose was
  related to faster and less accurate performance, whereas core temperature
  rises had the opposite effect. The 50\% correlation between plasma glucose
  and core temperatures observed during exercise in the heat may help to
  stabilize cognitive performance via their opposing effects. The glucose-like
  effects of sports drinks appear to be mediated by increased plasma glucose
  levels, because drinks effects became non-significant when plasma glucose
  levels were added to the models. The cooling intervention had only a
  beneficial effect on complex visuo-motor speed. © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons

    It was recently observed that dehydration causes shrinkage of brain tissue
  and an associated increase in ventricular volume. Negative effects of
  dehydration on cognitive performance have been shown in some but not all
  studies, and it has also been reported that an increased perceived effort may
  be required following dehydration. However, the effects of dehydration on
  brain function are unknown. We investigated this question using functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 10 healthy adolescents (mean age = 16.8,
  five females). Each subject completed a thermal exercise protocol and
  nonthermal exercise control condition in a cross-over repeated measures
  design. Subjects lost more weight via perspiration in the thermal exercise
  versus the control condition (P {\textless} 0.0001), and lateral ventricle
  enlargement correlated with the reduction in body mass (r = 0.77, P = 0.01).
  Dehydration following the thermal exercise protocol led to a significantly
  stronger increase in fronto-parietal blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)
  response during an executive function task (Tower of London) than the control
  condition, whereas cerebral perfusion during rest was not affected. The
  increase in BOLD response after dehydration was not paralleled by a change in
  cognitive performance, suggesting an inefficient use of brain metabolic
  activity following dehydration. This pattern indicates that participants
  exerted a higher level of neuronal activity in order to achieve the same
  performance level. Given the limited availability of brain metabolic
  resources, these findings suggest that prolonged states of reduced water
  intake may adversely impact executive functions such as planning and
  visuo-spatial processing.%

    Stimulating as well as detrimental effects of exercise on cognitive
  functioning have been reported. In the present study, 15 endurance-trained
  athletes (aged 18 to 42 years) performed a bicycle ergometer endurance test
  at 75\% of their maximal work capacity (Wmax). Psychomotor and cognitive
  tests were administered before and immediately after exercise. These
  consisted of simple reaction time (RT), 3-choice RT and Stimulus-Response
  (S-R) incompatible RT tasks, a finger-tapping task, and the Stroop test.
  Simple RT tasks, but also the more complex S-R in compatible RT, and Color
  Word Interference in the Stroop test showed an increase in speed of
  performance after exercise relative to baseline. An enhanced activation was
  probably responsible for this better performance on psychomotor and cognitive
  tests. Since performance on the most complex task, the Interference subtest
  of the Stroop, was especially improved after exercise, the expectancy of the
  subjects of a potential positive effect of exercise was thought to have been
  responsible.%

  performance of 40 randomly selected healthy pilots after having high and low

    BACKGROUND: How hypohydration impacts non-bodyweight (BW)-dependent muscle
  performance and vertical jumping ability remains to be determined using
  meta-analytic procedures. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to determine the
  impact of hypohydration on muscle endurance, strength, anaerobic power and
  capacity and vertical jumping ability using a meta-analytic approach. DATA
  SOURCES: Studies were located using database searches and cross-referencing.
  SYNTHESIS METHODS: Effect summaries were obtained using random-effects
  models; method of moments mixed-effects analysis-of-variance-like procedures
  were used to determine differences between groups; and restricted maximum
  likelihood random-effects meta-regressions were performed to determine
  relationships between variables, impact of confounders, and interaction
  effects. RESULTS: A total of 28 manuscripts met the inclusion criteria,
  producing six (upper body muscle endurance), ten (lower body muscle
  endurance), 14 (upper body muscle strength), 25 (lower body muscle strength),
  nine (muscle anaerobic power), nine (muscle anaerobic capacity), and 12
  (vertical jumping ability) effect estimates. Hypohydration impaired overall
  muscle endurance by 8.3 ± 2.3\% (P {\textless} 0.05), with no significant
  difference between upper body (-8.4 ± 3.3\%) and lower body (-8.2 ± 3.2\%).
  As a whole, muscle strength fell by 5.5 ± 1.0\% (P {\textless} 0.05) with
  hypohydration; the difference between lower (-3.7 ± 1.8\%) and upper (-6.2
  ± 1.1\%) body was non-significant. Anaerobic power (-5.8 ± 2.3\%) was
  significantly altered with hypohydration, but anaerobic capacity (-3.5 ±
  2.3\%) and vertical jumping ability (0.9 ± 0.7\%) were not. No significant
  correlations were observed between the changes in any of the muscle
  performance variables or vertical jumping ability and the changes in
  hypohydration level. Using an active procedure to dehydrate participants
  decreased muscle performance by an additional 5.4 ± 1.9\% (2.76-fold) (P =
  0.02) compared with using a passive dehydration procedure. Trained
  individuals demonstrated a 3.3 ± 1.7\% (1.76-fold) (P = 0.06) lesser
  decrease in muscle performance with hypohydration than did untrained
  individuals. CONCLUSION: Hypohydration, or factors associated with
  dehydration, are likely to be associated with practically important
  decrements in muscle endurance, strength, and anaerobic power and capacity.
  However, their impact on non-BW-dependent muscle performance is substantially
  mitigated in trained individuals or when hypohydration is induced passively.
  Conversely, it is possible that body water loss ({\textasciitilde}3\% BW) may
  improve performance in BW-dependent tasks such as vertical jumping ability.%

    PURPOSE: To determine the effect of 1, 2, 3, and 4\% dehydration (DEH)
  versus euhydration (EUH) on basketball performance in adult male players.
  METHODS: Seventeen 17- to 28-yr-old male basketball players completed 3 h of
  interval treadmill walking (40 degrees C and 20\% relative humidity) with or
  without fluid replacement. Subjects completed six trials in random order: 1)
  EUH with a carbohydrate-electrolyte solution (CES), 2) EUH control (flavored
  water with 0\% carbohydrate and 18 mM sodium), 3) 1\% DEH, 4) 2\% DEH, 5) 3\%
  DEH, and 6) 4\% DEH. After a 70-min recovery period, subjects performed a
  sequence of continuous basketball drills designed to simulate a fast-paced
  game. Measures of overall skill performance during the 80-min game included
  1) total time to complete basketball-specific movement drills (sprinting,
  defensive slides, sprinting-defensive slides combination, and repetitive
  jumping drills) and 2) total number of shots (foul-line and baseline jump
  shots, layups, three-point, 15-ft, free throws) made per game. RESULTS:
  Performance during all timed and shooting drills declined progressively as \%
  DEH increased. Total time to complete basketball-specific movement drills was
  slower (1\%: + 7 +/- 6; 2\%: + 20 +/- 5 (P {\textless} 0.05); 3\%: + 26 +/- 7
  (P {\textless} 0.005); 4\%: + 57 +/- 9 (P {\textless} 0.0001) s), and fewer
  shots were made during DEH versus EUH control (1\%: -5 +/- 1; 2\%: -6 +/- 2
  (P {\textless} 0.05); 3\%: -8 +/- 2 (P {\textless} 0.005); 4\%: -10 +/- 1 (P
  {\textless} 0.0001) shots made). There were no significant differences in
  performance between CES and EUH control. CONCLUSION: Basketball players
  experienced a progressive deterioration in performance as DEH progressed from
  1 to 4\%. The threshold, or \% DEH at which the performance decrement reached
  statistical significance, was 2\% for combined timed and shooting drills.%

    Cognitive and mood decrements resulting from mild dehydration and glucose
  consumption were studied. Men and women (total N = 54; M age = 19.8 yr., SD =
  1.2) were recruited from college athletic teams. Euhydration or dehydration
  was achieved by athletes completing team practices with or without water
  replacement. Dehydration was associated with higher thirst and negative mood
  ratings as well as better Digit Span performance. Participants showed better
  Vigilance Attention with euhydration. Hydration status and athlete's sex
  interacted with performance on Choice Reaction Time and Vigilance Attention.
  In a second study, half of the athletes received glucose prior to cognitive
  testing. Results for negative mood and thirst ratings were similar, but for
  cognitive performance the results were mixed. Effects of glucose on cognition
  were independent of dehydration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all

    \field{abstract}{%
    The instinct of thirst was a cardinal element in the successful
  colonization by vertebrates of the dry land of the planet, which began in the
  Ordovician period about 400 million y ago. It is a commonplace experience in
  humans that drinking water in response to thirst following fluid loss is a
  pleasant experience. However, continuing to drink water once thirst has been
  satiated becomes unpleasant and, eventually, quite aversive. Functional MRI
  experiments reported here show pleasantness of drinking is associated with
  activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann area 32) and the
  orbitofrontal cortex. The unpleasantness and aversion of overdrinking is
  associated with activation in the midcingulate cortex, insula, amygdala, and
  periaqueductal gray. Drinking activations in the putamen and cerebellum also
  correlated with the unpleasantness of water, and the motor cortex showed
  increased activation during overdrinking compared with drinking during
  thirst. These activations in motor regions may possibly reflect volitional
  effort to conduct compliant drinking in the face of regulatory mechanisms
  inhibiting intake. The results suggestive of a specific inhibitory system in
  the control of drinking are unique.%

    The impact of asking children to drink water during their school days, and
  its possible influence on school performance, has been little considered
  using intervention studies. Therefore in the afternoon the cognitive
  functioning of 40 children (mean of 8 years and 7 months) was assessed twice,
  once after drinking 300 ml of water and on another day when no water was
  provided. Memory was assessed by the recall of 15 previously presented
  objects. Recall was significantly better on the occasions when water had been
  consumed. The ability to sustain attention was measured by asking the child
  to respond to a light that followed an auditory warning after a delay of
  either 3 or 12 s. The ability to sustain attention was not significantly
  influenced by whether water had been drunk.%

    We have developed a toolbox and graphic user interface, EEGLAB, running
  under the crossplatform MATLAB environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) for
  processing collections of single-trial and/or averaged EEG data of any number
  of channels. Available functions include EEG data, channel and event
  information importing, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole
  model plotting, plus multi-trial ERP-image plots), preprocessing (including
  artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging), independent
  component analysis (ICA) and time/frequency decompositions including channel
  and component cross-coherence supported by bootstrap statistical methods
  based on data resampling. EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers.
  Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic
  interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to
  tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow
  users to customize data processing using command history and interactive
  'pop' functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and
  stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis
  scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A
  'plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main
  menu. EEGLAB is freely available (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) under the
  GNU public license for noncommercial use and open source development,
  together with sample data, user tutorial and extensive documentation.%

    Limited information is available regarding the effects of mild dehydration
  on cognitive function. Therefore, mild dehydration was produced by
  intermittent moderate exercise without hyperthermia and its effects on
  cognitive function of women were investigated. Twenty-five females (age 23.0
  ± 0.6 y) participated in three 8-h, placebo-controlled experiments involving
  a different hydration state each day: exercise-induced dehydration with no
  diuretic (DN), exerciseinduced dehydration plus diuretic (DD; furosemide, 40
  mg), and euhydration (EU). Cognitive performance, mood, and symptoms of
  dehydration were assessed during each experiment, 3 times at rest and during
  each of 3 exercise sessions. The DN and DD trials in which a volunteer
  attained a ≥1\% level of dehydration were pooled and compared to that
  volunteer's equivalent EU trials. Mean dehydration achieved during these DN
  and DD trials was 21.36 ± 0.16\% of body mass. Significant adverse effects
  of dehydration were present at rest and during exercise for vigor-activity,
  fatigue-inertia, and total mood disturbance scores of the Profile of Mood
  States and for task difficulty, concentration, and headache as assessed by
  questionnaire. Most aspects of cognitive performance were not affected by
  dehydration. Serum osmolality, a marker of hydration, was greater in the mean
  of the dehydrated trials in which a ≥1\% level of dehydration was achieved
  (P = 0.006) compared to EU. In conclusion, degraded mood, increased
  perception of task difficulty, lower concentration, and headache symptoms
  resulted from 1.36\% dehydration in females. Increased emphasis on optimal
  hydration is warranted, especially during and after moderate exercise. ©

    PURPOSE: To determine the effects of dehydration (DEH) on attentional
  vigilance in male basketball players. METHODS: The Test of Variables of
  Attention (TOVA; Universal Attention Disorders) was administered to 11 male
  basketball players (17-28 yr) at baseline (test 1), after walking (50\%
  V̇O2max) in the heat (40°C and 20\% relative humidity) (test 2), and then
  after a simulated basketball game (test 3). Tests 2 and 3 were performed
  while subjects were either DEH (1-4\%) or euhydrated (EUH). The TOVA
  consisted of target-infrequent and target-frequent conditions, simulating
  static and dynamic (such as a basketball game) environments, respectively.
  TOVA measures included errors of omission (OE) and commission (CE), response
  time (RT), and sensitivity. RESULTS: During the target-infrequent half of
  test 3, EUH resulted in significantly better sensitivity (+0.4 ± 1.2 vs -0.9
  ± 1.3), faster RT (-8 ± 20 vs +16 ± 28), and fewer OE (-0.4 ± 0.7 vs +1.3
  ± 2.4) compared with DEH. During the target-frequent half, EUH resulted in
  significantly fewer OE (-4 ± 15 vs +5 ± 7) and CE (-1.9 ± 3.2 vs 0.6
  ±1.4)in test 2 and greater sensitivity (+0.7 ± 2.6 vs -0.7 ± 1.1) and
  faster RT (-21 ± 28 vs +5 ± 31) than DEH in test 3. CONCLUSION:
  Vigilance-related attention of male basketball players was impaired by DEH,
  especially during the target-frequent condition of the TOVA. These results
  suggest that fluid replacement is essential to prevent the decline in
  vigilance that occurs with DEH in highly dynamic environments. Therefore,
  basketball players should be advised to maintain EUH for optimal
  concentration and attentional skills during competition. ©2007The American
  College of Sports Medicine.%

    Effect of acute mild dehydration on cognitive-motor performance in golf. J
  Strength Cond Res 26(11): 3075-3080, 2012-Whether mild dehydration (21 to 3\%
  body mass change [DBM]) impairs neurophysiological function during
  sport-specific cognitive-motor performance has yet to be fully elucidated. To
  investigate this within a golfing context, 7 low-handicap players (age: 21 6
  1.1 years; mass: 76.1 6 11.8 kg; stature: 1.77 6 0.07 m; handicap: 3.0 6 1.2)
  completed a golf-specific motor and cognitive performance task in a
  euhydrated condition (EC) and dehydrated condition (DC) (randomized
  counterbalanced design; 7-day interval). Dehydration was controlled using a
  previously effective 12-hour fluid restriction, monitored through DBM and
  urine color assessment (UCOL). Mild dehydration reduced the mean BM by 1.5 6
  0.5\% (p = 0.01), with UCOL increasing from 2 (EC) to 4 (DC) (p = 0.02). Mild
  dehydration significantly impaired motor performance, expressed as shot
  distance (114.6 vs. 128.6 m; p , 0.001) and off-Target accuracy (7.9 vs. 4.1
  m; p = 0.001). Cognitive performance, expressed as the mean error in distance
  judgment to target increased from 4.16 3.0 m (EC) to 8.86 4.7 m (DC) (p ,
  0.001). The findings support those of previous research that indicates mild
  dehydration (21 to 2\% DBM) significantly impairs cognitive-motor task
  performance. This study is the first to show that mild dehydration can impair
  distance, accuracy, and distance judgment during golf performance. © 2012

    O objetivo desse estudo foi avaliar o estado de hidratação e desempenho
  cognitivo-motor em atletas durante uma prova de fast triathlon no calor. Doze
  triatletas (34 ± 2,7 anos) participaram do trabalho. O estado de
  hidratação foi mensurado pela perda de massa corporal (MC), coloração e
  gravidade específica (GE) urinárias. O desempenho cognitivo-motor foi
  verificado pela coordenação motora (CM) e tempo de reação simples (TRS).
  Após a prova houve uma diminuição significativa da MC (1,8 \%; P
  {\textless} 0,001). Um aumento significativo entre pré e pós-competição
  foi observado para o índice de coloração da urina (P {\textless} 0,001) e
  GE (P {\textless} 0,001), respectivamente. O TRS foi melhor após a prova.
  Porém, demonstraram dismetria, prejudicando sua CM. Conclui-se que níveis
  de desidratação foram observados entre os atletas após a prova.
  Alterações opostas foram encontradas quanto ao desempenho cognitivo-motor.
  Atletas demonstraram uma maior descoordenação motora, mas melhoraram seu
  tempo de reação.Palavras-Chave: Desempenho atlético; Desidratação; Tempo

    Investigated the effects of heat exposure, exercise-induced dehydration,
  and fluid ingestion on cognitive performance. Seven healthy men were kept
  euhydrated or were dehydrated by controlled passive exposure to heat (H) or
  by treadmill exercise (E) up to a weight loss of 2.8\%. On completion of a
  4-hr recovery, Ss drank a glucose/NaCl solution corresponding to 100\% of
  body weight loss induced by dehydration. (H1 and E1) or levels of fluid
  deficit were maintained (H0, E0). In the E0, H0, and control conditions, the
  S drank a solution containing the same quantity of glucose diluted in water.
  Tests of long- and short-term memory, perceptive discrimination, reaction
  time, and tracking were given 30 min after dehydration and 2 hrs after fluid
  ingestion. Both dehydration conditions impaired cognitive abilities
  (perceptive discrimination, short-term memory), as well as feelings of
  fatigue, without any relevant differences between the methods. By 3.5 hrs
  after fluid deficit, dehydration (H0 and E0) no longer had any adverse
  effect. Thus, there was no beneficial effect of fluid ingestion (H1 and El)
  on cognitive variables. However, long-term memory retrieval was impaired in
  both control and dehydration situations, whereas there was no performance
  decrement with fluid ingestion (H1, E1). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016
