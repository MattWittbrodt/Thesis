    \field{abstract}{%
    Human neuropsychology investigates brain-behavior relationships, using
  objective tools (neurological tests) to tie the biological and behavior
  aspects together. The use of neuropsychological assessment tools in assessing
  potential effects of dehydration is a natural progression of the scientific
  pursuit to understand the physical and mental ramifications of dehydration.
  It has long been known that dehydration negatively affects physical
  performance. Examining the effects of hydration status on cognitive function
  is a relatively new area of research, resulting in part from our increased
  understanding of hydration's impact on physical performance and advances in
  the discipline of cognitive neuropsychology. The available research in this
  area, albeit sparse, indicates that decrements in physical, visuomotor,
  psychomotor, and cognitive performance can occur when 2\% or more of body
  weight is lost due to water restriction, heat, and/or physical exertion.
  Additional research is needed, especially studies designed to reduce, if not
  remove, the limitations of studies conducted to date.%

    Although it is well known that water is essential for human homeostasis and
  survival, only recently have we begun to understand its role in the
  maintenance of brain function. Herein, we integrate emerging evidence
  regarding the effects of both dehydration and additional acute water
  consumption on cognition and mood. Current findings in the field suggest that
  particular cognitive abilities and mood states are positively influenced by
  water consumption. The impact of dehydration on cognition and mood is
  particularly relevant for those with poor fluid regulation, such as the
  elderly and children. We critically review the most recent advances in both
  behavioural and neuroimaging studies of dehydration and link the findings to
  the known effects of water on hormonal, neurochemical and vascular functions
  in an attempt to suggest plausible mechanisms of action. We identify some
  methodological weaknesses, including inconsistent measurements in cognitive
  assessment and the lack of objective hydration state measurements as well as
  gaps in knowledge concerning mediating factors that may influence water
  intervention effects. Finally, we discuss how future research can best
  elucidate the role of water in the optimal maintenance of brain health and
  function.%

    Dehydration is a reliable predictor of impaired cognitive status. Objective
  data, using tests of cortical function, support the deterioration of mental
  performance in mildly dehydrated younger adults. Dehydration frequently
  results in delirium as a manifestation of cognitive dysfunction. Although,
  the occurrence of delirium suggests transient acute global cerebral
  dysfunction, cognitive impairment may not be completely reversible. Animal
  studies have identified neuronal mitochondrial damage and glutamate
  hypertransmission in dehydrated rats. Additional studies have identified an
  increase in cerebral nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase
  activity (nitric oxide synthase, NOS) with dehydration. Available evidence
  also implicates NOS as a neurotransmitter in long-term potentiation,
  rendering this a critical enzyme in facilitating learning and memory. With
  ageing, a reduction of NOS activity has been identified in the cortex and
  striatum of rats. The reduction of NOs synthase activity that occurs with
  ageing may blunt the rise that occurs with dehydration, and possibly
  interfere with memory processing and cognitive function. Dehydration has been
  shown to be a reliable predictor of increasing frailty, deteriorating mental
  performance and poor quality of life. Intervention models directed toward
  improving outcomes in dehydration must incorporate strategies to enhance
  prompt recognition of cognitive dysfunction.%

    The effect of primary dehydration of various levels (1, 2 and 3\%
  body-weight deficits) on mental functions of different complexities were
  studied in eight heat-acclimatized subjects drawn from tropical regions of
  India. These subjects were also studied after a bout of exercise in heat
  under two conditions viz., Hot Dry (45°C DB, 30\% rh), and Hot Humid (39DC
  DB, 60\% rh) at 34°C WBGT. No significant change in routine mental work was
  seen either under dehydration per se of any level or after subsequent
  exercise under heat when compared with the normal state. On the other hand,
  at 2 and 3\% levels of primary dehydration a further reduction was noted in
  all the functions though it was not significant. Inter-variations in Hot
  Humid and Hot Dry conditions were not significant except for more pronounced
  reductions in the concentration component in Hot Humid conditions.%

    Body water deficits or hypohydration (HYP) may degrade cognitive
  performance during heat exposure and perhaps temperate conditions. Cold
  exposure often induces HYP, but the combined effects of cold and HYP on
  cognitive performance are unknown. This study investigated whether HYP
  degrades cognitive performance during cold exposure and if physical exercise
  could mitigate any cold-induced performance decline. On four occasions, eight
  volunteers completed one hour of militarily-relevant cognitive testing: 30
  min of simulated sentry duty/marksmanship, 20 min of a visual vigilance task,
  a self-report workload assessment, and a mood questionnaire. Testing was
  conducted in a cold (2 degrees C) or temperate (20 degrees C) environment
  before and after cycle ergometer (60 min at 60\% of VO(2peak)) exercise. Each
  trial was preceded by 3 h of passive heat stress (45 degrees C) in the early
  morning with (euhydration, EUH) or without (hypohydration, HYP; 3\% body
  mass) fluid replacement followed by prolonged recovery. HYP did not alter any
  cognitive, psychomotor, or self-report parameter in either environment before
  or after exercise. Cold exposure increased (p{\textless}0.05) target
  detection latency in the sentry duty task, adversely affected mood and
  workload ratings, but had no impact on any other cognitive or psychomotor
  measure. After completing the exercise bout, there were modest improvements
  in friend-foe discrimination and total response latency in the sentry duty
  task, but not on any other performance measures. Moderate HYP had no effect
  on cognitive and psychomotor performance in either environment, cold exposure
  produced equivocal effects, and aerobic exercise improved some aspects of
  military task performance.;%

    Equivocal findings have been reported in the few studies that examined the
  impact of ambient temperature (T a) and hypohydration on cognition and
  dynamic balance. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of
  acute exposure to a range of ambient temperatures (T(a) 10-40 °C) in
  euhydration (EUH) and hypohydration (HYP) states on cognition, mood and
  dynamic balance. Thirty-two men (age 22 ± 4 years, height 1.80 ± 0.05 m,
  body mass 85.4 ± 10.8 kg) were grouped into four matched cohorts (n = 8),
  and tested in one of the four T(a) (10, 20, 30, 40 °C) when EUH and HYP (-4
  \% body mass via exercise-heat exposure). Cognition was assessed using
  psychomotor vigilance, 4-choice reaction time, matching to sample, and
  grammatical reasoning. Mood was evaluated by profile of mood states and
  dynamic postural balance was tested using a Biodex Balance System. Thermal
  sensation (TS), core (T core) and skin temperature (T(sk)) were obtained
  throughout testing. Volunteers lost -4.1 ± 0.4 \% body mass during HYP. T sk
  and TS increased with increasing T(a), with no effect of hydration. Cognitive
  performance was not altered by HYP or thermal stress. Total mood disturbance
  (TMD), fatigue, confusion, anger, and depression increased during HYP at all
  T(a). Dynamic balance was unaffected by HYP, but 10 °C exposure impaired
  balance compared to all other T(a). Despite an increase in TMD during HYP,
  cognitive function was maintained in all testing environments, demonstrating
  cognitive resiliency in response to body fluid deficits. Dynamic postural
  stability at 10 °C appeared to be hampered by low-grade shivering, but was
  otherwise maintained during HYP and thermal stress.;%

    Studying the effects of dehydration on cognitive function presents a
  variety of unique and difficult challenges to investigators. These
  challenges, which are addressed in this article, can be divided into three
  general categories: 1) choosing an appropriate method of generating a
  consistent level of dehydration; 2) determining and effectively employing
  appropriate and sensitive measures of cognitive state; and 3) adequately
  controlling the many confounding factors that interfere with assessment of
  cognitive function. The design and conduct of studies on the effects of
  dehydration on cognitive function should carefully consider various
  methodological issues, and investigators should carefully weigh the benefits
  and disadvantages of particular methods and procedures.%

    BACKGROUND: Military exercises generate high levels of stress to simulate
  combat, providing a unique opportunity to examine cognitive and physiologic
  responses of normal humans to acute stress. METHODS: Cognitive and
  physiologic markers of stress were evaluated before, during, and after an
  intense training exercise conducted for 53 hours in the heat. Cognitive
  performance, mood, physical activity, sleep, body composition, hydration, and
  saliva cortisol, testosterone, and melatonin were assessed. Volunteers were
  31 male U.S. Army officers from an elite unit, aged 31.6 +/- .4 years.
  RESULTS: Wrist activity monitors documented that soldiers slept only 3.0 +/-
  .3 hours during the exercise and were active throughout. Volunteers lost 4.1
  +/- .2 kg (p {\textless} .001) of weight, predominately water (3.1 +/- .3 L)
  (p {\textless} .001). Substantial degradation in cognitive function, assessed
  with computerized tests, occurred. Vigilance, reaction time, attention,
  memory, and reasoning were impaired (p {\textless} .001). Mood, including
  vigor (p {\textless} .001), fatigue (p {\textless} .001), confusion (p
  {\textless} .001), depression (p {\textless} .001), and tension (p
  {\textless} .002), assessed by questionnaire, deteriorated. The highest
  cortisol and testosterone levels were observed before the exercise.
  CONCLUSIONS: This study quantifies the overwhelmingly adverse impact of
  multiple stressors on cognitive performance, mood, and physiologic
  parameters, during a continuous but brief military exercise conducted by
  highly motivated, well-trained officers.%

    How does a lack of sleep affect our brains? In contrast to the benefits of
  sleep, frameworks exploring the impact of sleep loss are relatively lacking.
  Importantly, the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) do not simply reflect the
  absence of sleep and the benefits attributed to it; rather, they reflect the
  consequences of several additional factors, including extended wakefulness.
  With a focus on neuroimaging studies, we review the consequences of SD on
  attention and working memory, positive and negative emotion, and hippocampal
  learning. We explore how this evidence informs our mechanistic understanding
  of the known changes in cognition and emotion associated with SD, and the
  insights it provides regarding clinical conditions associated with sleep
  disruption.%

    Acute hypoglycemia impairs functions of the central nervous system, but few
  controlled studies have assessed the impact of hypoglycemia on the function
  of the peripheral nervous system. Sixteen non-diabetic humans underwent two
  separate hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp procedures on different study days,
  in a counter-balanced fashion. On one occasion, euglycemia was maintained
  (blood glucose, 5.0 mmol l(-1)), and on the other occasion, hypoglycemia
  (blood glucose, 2.6 mmol l(-1)) was induced. During each condition, subjects
  performed a combined psychometric, cognitive-experimental and psychophysical
  test battery, and measures were made (in the dominant median and common
  peroneal nerves) of the motor nerve conduction velocities and the amplitudes
  of the motor action potentials. Hypoglycemia caused impaired performance of
  general cognitive and information processing tasks (P{\textless}.05), but
  nerve conduction velocities and the amplitudes of motor action potentials
  were unaffected. Conduction velocities of the common peroneal nerve decreased
  from baseline within each experimental condition, perhaps due to
  hyperinsulinemia. Overall, these results demonstrate that multiple levels of
  information processing in the brain may alter while peripheral nerve function
  remains intact, and imply that peripheral neurons do not have the same
  obligate requirement for glucose as a metabolic fuel as neurons of the
  central nervous system.%

    There were 44 young men who participated in strenuous combat courses of 4 d

  examined clinically each morning. Groups 1 and 2 had no organized sleep,
  whereas groups 3 and 4 got 3 and 6 h, respectively, in the middle of each
  course. Substantial impairment was observed in all tests, as well as clinical
  symptoms toward the end of the courses for groups 1 and 2. In the vigilance
  test, the reaction time task, the code test, and the profile of mood-state,
  significant impairment was observed even after 24 h. Complaints of symptoms
  came first. Disturbance of senses and behaviour appeared later. Group 4 had
  significantly better results than groups 1 and 2 in clinical symptoms and all
  tests, except the positive score in mood-state. Group 3 occupied an
  intermediate position. Corresponding results were obtained in the two
  separate courses. In the morning following the course, recovery after 4 h of
  sleep was less extensive for courses II than course I participants.%

    Twenty five subjects acclimatised to heat artificially were exposed to
  "basic effective temperatures" (BET) of 25.0 degrees, 29.6 degrees, 32.2
  degrees, 33.3 degrees and 35.0 degrees C BET under conditions of both humid
  and dry heat. The object of the investigation was to ascertain the nature of
  effects of varying degrees of heat stress on mental alertness, associative
  learning, reasoning ability and dual-performance efficiency. A further aim
  was to determine the temperature levels at which impairment of psychological
  functions was severe enough to be of practical concern. The duration of each
  exposure was four hours, during which subjects performed physical exercise
  followed by rest every 30 min. It was found that all the psychological
  functions tested were adversely affected under extreme heat, and that a
  significant drop in various psychological functions was seen at effective
  temperatures of 32.2 degrees C and 33.3 degrees C in hot-humid and hot-dry
  conditions respectively. It is concluded that at the same effective
  temperatures the magnitude of the overall effect on psychological functions
  under humid conditions is relatively greater than that under dry conditions.%

    Body water losses of {\textgreater}2 \% of body mass are defined as
  hypohydration and can occur from sweat loss and/or diuresis from both cold
  and altitude exposure. Hypohydration elicits intracellular and extracellular
  water loss proportionate to water and solute deficits. Iso-osmotic
  hypovolemia (from cold and high-altitude exposure) results in greater plasma
  loss for a given water deficit than hypertonic hypovolemia from sweat loss.
  Hypohydration does not impair submaximal intensity aerobic performance in
  cold-cool environments, sometimes impairs aerobic performance in temperate
  environments, and usually impairs aerobic performance in warm-hot
  environments. Hypohydration begins to impair aerobic performance when skin
  temperatures exceed 27 degrees C, and with each additional 1 degrees C
  elevation in skin temperature there is a further 1.5 \% impairment.
  Hypohydration has an additive effect on impairing aerobic performance in
  warm-hot high-altitude environments. A commonality of absolute hypovolemia
  (from plasma volume loss) combined with relative hypovolemia (from tissue
  vasodilation) is present when aerobic performance is impaired. The decrement
  in aerobic exercise performance due to hypohydration is likely due to
  multiple physiological mechanisms, including cardiovascular strain acting as
  the 'lynchpin', elevated tissue temperatures, and metabolic changes which are
  all integrated through the CNS to reduce motor drive to skeletal muscles.%

    This article provides a comprehensive review of dehydration assessment and
  presents a unique evaluation of the dehydration and performance literature.
  The importance of osmolality and volume are emphasized when discussing the
  physiology, assessment, and performance effects of dehydration. The
  underappreciated physiologic distinction between a loss of hypo-osmotic body
  water (intracellular dehydration) and an iso-osmotic loss of body water
  (extracellular dehydration) is presented and argued as the single most
  essential aspect of dehydration assessment. The importance of diagnostic and
  biological variation analyses to dehydration assessment methods is reviewed
  and their use in gauging the true potential of any dehydration assessment
  method highlighted. The necessity for establishing proper baselines is
  discussed, as is the magnitude of dehydration required to elicit reliable and
  detectable osmotic or volume-mediated compensatory physiologic responses. The
  discussion of physiologic responses further helps inform and explain our
  analysis of the literature suggesting a {\textgreater}/= 2\% dehydration
  threshold for impaired endurance exercise performance mediated by volume
  loss. In contrast, no clear threshold or plausible mechanism(s) support the
  marginal, but potentially important, impairment in strength, and power
  observed with dehydration. Similarly, the potential for dehydration to impair
  cognition appears small and related primarily to distraction or discomfort.
  The impact of dehydration on any particular sport skill or task is therefore
  likely dependent upon the makeup of the task itself (e.g., endurance,
  strength, cognitive, and motor skill).%

    Although it has been suggested that many in the general population are
  dehydrated to the extent that mood and cognition are disrupted, there has
  been little research investigating mild levels of dehydration. When
  dehydration reduces body mass by more than 2\%, it has been consistently
  reported that mood is influenced, fatigue is greater, and alertness is lower.
  In contrast, the effects on cognition have been less consistent. Only a few
  studies have looked at females and these studies made little attempt to
  consider hormones that influence kidney functioning. In particular, there has
  been virtually no attempt to look at changes in hydration status in the range
  that occurs in individuals with a sedentary lifestyle in a temperate climate.
  There is a consequent need to study individuals who have lost up to 1\% of
  body mass due to dehydration. While 4 intervention trials have found that the
  cognition of children improved in response to water consumption, the effects
  of water consumption on cognition in older adults, another high-risk group,
  have been largely ignored.%

    Sweat losses in team sports can be significant due to repeated bursts of
  high-intensity activity, as well as the large body size of athletes,
  equipment and uniform requirements, and environmental heat stress often
  present during training and competition. In this paper we aimed to: (1)
  describe sweat losses and fluid balance changes reported in team sport
  athletes, (2) review the literature assessing the impact of hypohydration on
  cognitive, technical, and physical performance in sports-specific studies,
  (3) briefly review the potential mechanisms by which hypohydration may impact
  team sport performance, and (4) discuss considerations for future directions.
  Significant hypohydration (mean body mass loss (BML) {\textgreater}2\%) has
  been reported most consistently in soccer. Although American Football, rugby,
  basketball, tennis, and ice hockey have reported high sweating rates, fluid
  balance disturbances have generally been mild (mean BML {\textless}2\%),
  suggesting that drinking opportunities were sufficient for most athletes to
  offset significant fluid losses. The effect of hydration status on team sport
  performance has been studied mostly in soccer, basketball, cricket, and
  baseball, with mixed results. Hypohydration typically impaired performance at
  higher levels of BML (3–4\%) and when the method of dehydration involved
  heat stress. Increased subjective ratings of fatigue and perceived exertion
  consistently accompanied hypohydration and could explain, in part, the
  performance impairments reported in some studies. More research is needed to
  develop valid, reliable, and sensitive sport-specific protocols and should be
  used in future studies to determine the effects of hypohydration and
  modifying factors (e.g., age, sex, athlete caliber) on team sport
  performance.%

    Dehydration (body water deficit) is a physiologic state that can have
  profound implications for human health and performance. Unfortunately,
  dehydration can be difficult to assess, and there is no single, universal
  gold standard for decision making. In this article, we review the physiologic
  basis for understanding quantitative dehydration assessment. We highlight how
  phenomenologic interpretations of dehydration depend critically on the type
  (dehydration compared with volume depletion) and magnitude (moderate compared
  with severe) of dehydration, which in turn influence the osmotic (plasma
  osmolality) and blood volume-dependent compensatory thresholds for
  antidiuretic and thirst responses. In particular, we review new findings
  regarding the biological variation in osmotic responses to dehydration and
  discuss how this variation can help provide a quantitative and clinically
  relevant link between the physiology and phenomenology of dehydration.
  Practical measures with empirical thresholds are provided as a starting point
  for improving the practice of dehydration assessment.%

    Objective: While brief bouts of exercise improve cognitive function, more
  prolonged exercise can suppress attention and executive function. Dehydration
  and heat exposure are known contributors to these deficits, though the role
  of blood sugar changes during exercise in cognitive dysfunction is less
  understood at this time. The current study sought to clarify the independent
  contribution of blood glucose levels to cognitive function following
  demanding exercise. Method: Healthy adult males (N= 10, age= 21.9 +/- 1.97
  years) presented for two counterbalanced experimental trials in a 100 degrees
  F heated chamber. Each experimental trial consisted of BASELINE glucose and
  cognitive function assessments, as measured by the Logical Relations (LR) and
  Running Memory Continuous Performance Task (RMCPT) subtests of the Automated
  Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics- 4th Edition (ANAM4). Participants then
  completed 120 minutes of exercise on a cycle ergometer, with glucose and
  cognitive function measured POST-EXERCISE. Next, participants rehydrated with
  a zero-sugar or full-sugar sports beverage, with measures of glucose and
  cognitive function repeated immediately POST-REHYDRATION. Finally, after a
  15-minute recovery period during which the participants rested while not
  permitted to drink, they completed experimental measures an additional time,
  at POST-RECOVERY. Results: Physiological response to the experimental trials
  was similar across conditions. Participants demonstrated significantly
  reduced blood glucose levels (F(1,9)=16.93, p{\textless}0.01) and lost an
  average of 2.57\% of their body weight following exercise. Contrary to
  hypotheses, repeated measures ANOVA showed performance on LR did not change
  from BASELINE to POST-EXERCISE and actually declined from POST-EXERCISE to
  POST-REHYDRATION (F(1,9)=9.44, p=0.01). Performance on RMCPT improved from
  BASELINE to POST-EXERCISE (F(19)=5.43, p{\textless}0.05) and the zero-sugar
  condition produced gains from POST-REHYDRATION to POST-RECOVERY (F(1,9)=6.45,
  p=0.03) relative to the full-sugar condition. Conclusion: Contrary to past
  studies, cognitive function did not universally decline with strenuous
  exercise, despite reduced blood glucose levels. Performances on an attention
  measure increased following exercise and were unexpectedly better at
  POST-RECOVERY for the zero- versus the full-sugar condition. However,
  executive functioning was stable to POST-EXERCISE and declined following
  rehydration. The exact mechanisms responsible for this pattern of findings
  are unclear, but likely involve a combination of limited core temperature
  increase and dehydration level, reactivity to blood sugar fluctuations, and
  multiple possible variables not assessed in the current study such as
  neurotransmitter and blood lactate levels, brain temperature, physiological
  arousal, and task engagement. Future studies are needed to better understand
  the inconsistent findings across the literature, as a significant number of
  individuals engage in strenuous and prolonged exercise regularly, including
  those involved in service positions (i.e., military personnel and
  firefighters). Articulating the mechanisms at play in this phenomenon may
  increase safety and improve performance.%

  to Meta-analysis is intended to be primarily conceptual, and it is amazingly
  successful at achieving that goal. The reader can comfortably skip the
  formulas and still understand their application and underlying motivation.
  For the more statistically sophisticated reader, the relevant formulas and
  worked examples provide a superb practical guide to performing a
  meta-analysis. The book provides an eclectic mix of examples from education,
  social science, biomedical studies, and even ecology. For anyone considering
  leading a course in meta-analysis, or pursuing self-directed study,
  Introduction to Meta-analysis would be a clear first choice. Jesse A. Berlin,

    Purpose: The impact of mild hypohydration on physiological responses and
  cognitive performance following exercise-heat stress (EHS) were examined
  compared with conditions when fluids were ingested ad libitum (AL) or
  replaced to match sweat losses (FR). Methods: Twelve unacclimatized,
  recreationally-active men (22.2 +/- 2.4 y) completed 50 min cycling
  (60\%VO2peak) in the heat (32 degrees C; 65\% RH) under three conditions: no
  fluid (NF), AL, and FR. Before and after EHS, a cognitive battery was
  completed: Trail making, perceptual vigilance, pattern comparison,
  match-to-sample, and letter-digit recognition tests. Results: Hypohydration
  during NF was greater compared with AL and FR (NF: -1.5 +/- 0.6; AL: -0.3 +/-
  0.8; FR: -0.1 +/- 0.3\% body mass loss) resulting in higher core temperature
  (by 0.4, 0.5 degrees C), heart rate (by 13 and 15 b.min(-1)), and
  physiological strain (by 1.3, 1.5) at the end of EHS compared with AL and FR,
  respectively. Cognitive performance (response time and accuracy) was not
  altered by fluid condition; however, mean response time improved (p
  {\textless} .05) for letter-digit recognition (by 56.7 +/- 85.8 ms or 3.8\%;
  p {\textless} .05) and pattern comparison (by 80.6 +/- 57.4 ms or 7.1\%; p
  {\textless} .001), but mean accuracy decreased in trail making (by 1.2 +/-
  1.4\%; p = .01) after EHS (across all conditions). Conclusions: For
  recreational athletes, fluid intake effectively mitigated physiological
  strain induced by mild hypohydration; however, mild hypohydration resulting
  from EHS elicited no adverse changes in cognitive performance.%

    The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of mild
  hypohydration on performance during a prolonged, monotonous driving task.
  METHODS: Eleven healthy males (age 22+/-4y) were instructed to consume a
  volume of fluid in line with published guidelines (HYD trial) or 25\% of this
  intake (FR trial) in a crossover manner. Participants came to the laboratory
  the following morning after an overnight fast. One hour following a standard
  breakfast, a 120min driving simulation task began. Driver errors, including
  instances of lane drifting or late breaking, EEG and heart rate were recorded
  throughout the driving task RESULTS: Pre-trial body mass (P=0.692), urine
  osmolality (P=0.838) and serum osmolality (P=0.574) were the same on both
  trials. FR resulted in a 1.1+/-0.7\% reduction in body mass, compared to
  -0.1+/-0.6\% in the HYD trial (P=0.002). Urine and serum osmolality were both
  increased following FR (P{\textless}0.05). There was a progressive increase
  in the total number of driver errors observed during both the HYD and FR
  trials, but significantly more incidents were recorded throughout the FR
  trial (HYD 47+/-44, FR 101+/-84; ES=0.81; P=0.006) CONCLUSIONS: The results
  of the present study suggest that mild hypohydration, produced a significant
  increase in minor driving errors during a prolonged, monotonous drive,
  compared to that observed while performing the same task in a hydrated
  condition. The magnitude of decrement reported, was similar to that observed
  following the ingestion of an alcoholic beverage resulting in a blood alcohol
  content of approximately 0.08\% (the current UK legal driving limit), or
  while sleep deprived.%

    Previous research has shown that treating dependent effect sizes as
  independent inflates the variance of the mean effect size and introduces bias
  by giving studies with more effect sizes more weight in the meta-analysis.
  This article summarizes the different approaches to handling dependence that
  have been advocated by methodologists, some of which are more feasible to
  implement with education research studies than others. A case study using
  effect sizes from a recent meta-analysis of reading interventions is
  presented to compare the results obtained from different approaches to
  dealing with dependence. Overall, mean effect sizes and variance estimates
  were found to be similar, but estimates of indexes of heterogeneity varied.
  Meta-analysts are advised to explore the effect of the method of handling
  dependence on the heterogeneity estimates before conducting moderator
  analyses and to choose the approach to dependence that is best suited to
  their research question and their data set.%

    Conventional meta-analytic techniques rely on the assumption that effect
  size estimates from different studies are independent and have sampling
  distributions with known conditional variances. The independence assumption
  is violated when studies produce several estimates based on the same
  individuals or there are clusters of studies that are not independent (such
  as those carried out by the same investigator or laboratory). This paper
  provides an estimator of the covariance matrix of meta-regression
  coefficients that are applicable when there are clusters of internally
  correlated estimates. It makes no assumptions about the specific form of the
  sampling distributions of the effect sizes, nor does it require knowledge of
  the covariance structure of the dependent estimates. Moreover, this paper
  demonstrates that the meta-regression coefficients are consistent and
  asymptotically normally distributed and that the robust variance estimator is
  valid even when the covariates are random. The theory is asymptotic in the
  number of studies, but simulations suggest that the theory may yield accurate
  results with as few as 20-40 studies. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons,

    Although primary studies often report multiple outcomes, the covariances
  between these outcomes are rarely reported. This leads to difficulties when
  combining studies in a meta-analysis. This problem was recently addressed
  with the introduction of robust variance estimation. This new method enables
  the estimation of meta-regression models with dependent effect sizes, even
  when the dependence structure is unknown. Although robust variance estimation
  has been shown to perform well when the number of studies in the
  meta-analysis is large, previous simulation studies suggest that the
  associated tests often have Type I error rates that are much larger than
  nominal. In this article, I introduce 6 estimators with better small sample
  properties and study the effectiveness of these estimators via 2 simulation
  studies. The results of these simulations suggest that the best estimator
  involves correcting both the residuals and degrees of freedom used in the
  robust variance estimator. These studies also suggest that the degrees of
  freedom depend on not only the number of studies but also the type of
  covariates in the meta-regression. The fact that the degrees of freedom can
  be small, even when the number of studies is large, suggests that these
  small-sample corrections should be used more generally. I conclude with an
  example comparing the results of a meta-regression with robust variance
  estimation with the results from the corrected estimator.%

    The hormone cortisol is often believed to play a pivotal role in the
  effects of stress on human cognition. This meta-analysis is an attempt to
  determine the effects of acute cortisol administration on core executive
  functions. Drawing on both rodent and stress literatures, we hypothesized
  that acute cortisol administration would impair working memory and
  set-shifting but enhance inhibition. Additionally, because cortisol is
  thought to exert different nongenomic (rapid) and genomic (slow) effects, we
  further hypothesized that the effects of cortisol would differ as a function
  of the delay between cortisol administration and cognitive testing. Although
  the overall analyses were nonsignificant, after separating the rapid,
  nongenomic effects of cortisol from the slower, genomic effects of cortisol,
  the rapid effects of cortisol enhanced response inhibition, g+ = 0.113,
  p=.016, but impaired working memory, g+ = -0.315, p=.008, although these
  effects reversed over time. Contrary to our hypotheses, there was no effect
  of cortisol administration on set-shifting. Thus, although we did not find
  support for the idea that increases in cortisol influence set-shifting, we
  found that acute increases in cortisol exert differential effects on working
  memory and inhibition over time.%

    When performing physical work, sweat output often exceeds water intake,
  producing a body water deficit or dehydration. Specific to the work place,
  dehydration can adversely affect worker productivity, safety, and morale.
  Legislative bodies in North America such as the Occupational Safety and
  Health Administration (OSHA) and the American Conference of Governmental
  Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) recommend replacing fluids frequently when
  exposed to heat stress, such as one cup (250 ml) every 20 minutes when
  working in warm environments. However, the majority of legislative guidelines
  provide vague guidance and none take into account the effects of work
  intensity, specific environments, or protective clothing. Improved
  occupational guidelines for fluid and electrolyte replacement during hot
  weather occupational activities should be developed to include
  recommendations for fluid consumption before, during, and after work.%

    This paper describes the origins and history of multiple resource theory in
  accounting for differences in dual task interference. One particular
  application of the theory, the 4-dimensional multiple resources model, is
  described in detail, positing that there will be greater interference between
  two tasks to the extent that they share stages (perceptual/cognitive vs
  response) sensory modalities (auditory vs visual), codes (visual vs spatial)
  and channels of visual information (focal vs ambient). A computational
  rendering of this model is then presented. Examples are given of how the
  model predicts interference differences in operational environments. Finally,
  three challenges to the model are outlined regarding task demand coding, task
  allocation and visual resource competition.%

    It was recently observed that dehydration causes shrinkage of brain tissue
  and an associated increase in ventricular volume. Negative effects of
  dehydration on cognitive performance have been shown in some but not all
  studies, and it has also been reported that an increased perceived effort may
  be required following dehydration. However, the effects of dehydration on
  brain function are unknown. We investigated this question using functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 10 healthy adolescents (mean age = 16.8,
  five females). Each subject completed a thermal exercise protocol and
  nonthermal exercise control condition in a cross-over repeated measures
  design. Subjects lost more weight via perspiration in the thermal exercise
  versus the control condition (P {\textless} 0.0001), and lateral ventricle
  enlargement correlated with the reduction in body mass (r = 0.77, P = 0.01).
  Dehydration following the thermal exercise protocol led to a significantly
  stronger increase in fronto-parietal blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)
  response during an executive function task (Tower of London) than the control
  condition, whereas cerebral perfusion during rest was not affected. The
  increase in BOLD response after dehydration was not paralleled by a change in
  cognitive performance, suggesting an inefficient use of brain metabolic
  activity following dehydration. This pattern indicates that participants
  exerted a higher level of neuronal activity in order to achieve the same
  performance level. Given the limited availability of brain metabolic
  resources, these findings suggest that prolonged states of reduced water
  intake may adversely impact executive functions such as planning and
  visuo-spatial processing.%

    The purpose of the present study was to examine the influence of submaximal
  aerobic exercise duration on simple and complex cognitive performance. Eight
  well-trained male subjects agreed to participate in this study (trial group).
  A control group of eight regularly trained male subjects was included for
  comparative purposes. For the trial group, the experiment involved a critical
  flicker fusion test (CFF) and a map recognition task performed before, every
  20 min during, and immediately after, a 3-h cycling task at an intensity
  corresponding to approximately 60 \% of VO2max. Data were obtained over two
  experimental sessions with fluid ingestion (F) or no fluid (NF) ingestion.
  For the control group the experiment was the same but without exercise and
  fluid ingestion. In the trial group, a significant effect of hydration status
  was observed on physiological parameters (p {\textless}0.05). No effect was
  found on cognitive performance. A significant decrease in CFF performance was
  observed after 120 min of exercise when compared with the first 20 min
  (respectively for CFFmdi: 2.6 vs. 3.8 Hz), irrespective of experimental
  condition. A significant improvement in speed of response (respectively: 3291
  vs. 3062 msec for 20 and 120 min, respectively) and a decrease in error
  number (21.5 \% vs. 6.0 \% for 20 and 120 min, respectively) during the map
  recognition task were recorded between 80 min and 120 min when compared with
  the first 20 min of exercise. After 120 min the number of recorded errors was
  significantly greater indicating a shift in the accuracy-speed trade-off (6.0
  \% vs. 14.1 \% for 120 and 180 min, respectively). These results provide some
  evidence for exercise-induced facilitation of cognitive function. However
  this positive effect disappears during prolonged exercise--as evidenced
  within our study by an increase in errors during the complex task and an
  alteration in perceptual response (i.e. the appearance of symptoms of central
  fatigue).;%

    PURPOSE: Many researchers have addressed the potential effects of
  hyperthermia and dehydration on cognition, often revealing contradictory
  outcomes. A possible reason for this inconsistency is that experiments may
  have been inadequately designed for such effects. In this study, the impact
  of hyperthermia, dehydration and their combination on cognition were
  evaluated in eight young males, after accounting for a range of experimental
  limitations. METHODS: Passive heating and thermal clamping at two mean body
  temperatures (36.5, 38.5 °C) were performed under three hydration states
  (euhydrated, 3 and 5\% dehydrated) to assess their effects on
  difficulty-matched working memory and visual perception tasks, and on a
  difficulty manipulated perceptual task. Data were analysed according to
  signal detection theory to isolate changes in response sensitivity, bias and
  speed. RESULTS: Neither moderate hyperthermia (P = 0.141) nor dehydration
  (P {\textgreater} 0.604) modified response sensitivity, nor did they
  significantly interact (P {\textgreater} 0.698). Therefore, the ability
  to distinguish correct from incorrect responses was unaffected. Nevertheless,
  hyperthermia, but not dehydration (P = 0.301), reduced the response bias
  (-0.08 versus 2.2 [normothermia]; P = 0.010) and reaction time (mean
  reduction 49 ms; P {\textless} 0.001), eliciting more liberal and faster
  responses (P = 0.010). Response bias was reduced for the memory relative
  to the perceptual task (P = 0.037), and this effect was enhanced during
  hyperthermia (P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: These observations imply that,
  once potentially confounding influences were controlled, moderate
  hyperthermia, significant dehydration and their combined effects had
  insufficient impact to impair cognition within the memory and perceptual
  domains tested. Nonetheless, moderate hyperthermia elicited more liberal and
  rapid responses.%

    We investigated the cognitive effects of exercising in the heat on the
  field players of two football teams in a series of three matches. Different
  rehydration and cooling strategies were used for one of the teams during the
  last two games. Cognitive functions were measured before, during and
  immediately after each football match, as well as core temperature, body
  mass, plasma osmolality and glucose levels, allowing an estimate of their
  differential impacts on cognition. The pattern of results suggests that
  mild-moderate dehydration during exercise in the heat (up to 2.5\%) has no
  clear effect on cognitive function. Instead, plasma glucose and core
  temperature changes appear to be the main determinants: higher glucose was
  related to faster and less accurate performance, whereas core temperature
  rises had the opposite effect. The 50\% correlation between plasma glucose
  and core temperatures observed during exercise in the heat may help to
  stabilize cognitive performance via their opposing effects. The glucose-like
  effects of sports drinks appear to be mediated by increased plasma glucose
  levels, because drinks effects became non-significant when plasma glucose
  levels were added to the models. The cooling intervention had only a
  beneficial effect on complex visuo-motor speed. © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons

    Context: The effects of dehydration induced by wrestling-related
  weight-cutting tactics on clinical concussion outcomes, such as
  neurocognitive function, balance performance, and symptoms, have not been
  adequately studied. Objective: To evaluate the effects of dehydration on the
  outcome of clinical concussion measures in National Collegiate Athletic
  Association Division I collegiate wrestlers. Design: Repeated-measures
  design. Setting: Clinical research laboratory. Patients or Other
  Participants: Thirty-two Division I healthy collegiate male wrestlers (age =
  20.0 ± 1.4 years; height = 175.0 ±6 7.5 cm; baseline mass = 79.2 ± 12.6
  kg). Intervention(s): Participants completed preseason concussion baseline
  testing in early September. Weight and urine samples were also collected at
  this time. All participants reported to prewrestling practice and
  postwrestling practice for the same test battery and protocol in mid-October.
  They had begun practicing weight-cutting tactics a day before prepractice and
  postpractice testing. Differences between these measures permitted us to
  evaluate how dehydration and weight-cutting tactics affected concussion
  measures. Main Outcome Measures: Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 2 (SCAT2),
  Balance Error Scoring System, Graded Symptom Checklist, and Simple Reaction
  Time scores. The Simple Reaction Time was measured using the Automated
  Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics. Results: The SCAT2 measurements were
  lower at prepractice (P = .002) and postpractice (P {\textless} .001) when
  compared with baseline. The BESS error scores were higher at postpractice
  when compared with baseline (P = .015). The GSC severity scores were higher
  at prepractice (P = .011) and postpractice (P {\textless} .001) than at
  baseline and at postpractice when than at prepractice (P = .003). The number
  of Graded Symptom Checklist symptoms reported was also higher at prepractice
  (P = .036) and postpractice (P {\textless} .001) when compared with baseline,
  and at postpractice when compared with prepractice (P = .003). Conclusions:
  Our results suggest that it is important for wrestlers to be evaluated in a
  euhydrated state to ensure that dehydration is not influencing the outcome of
  the clinical measures.%

    PURPOSE: To determine the effects of dehydration (DEH) on attentional
  vigilance in male basketball players. METHODS: The Test of Variables of
  Attention (TOVA; Universal Attention Disorders) was administered to 11 male
  basketball players (17-28 yr) at baseline (test 1), after walking (50\%
  V̇O2max) in the heat (40°C and 20\% relative humidity) (test 2), and then
  after a simulated basketball game (test 3). Tests 2 and 3 were performed
  while subjects were either DEH (1-4\%) or euhydrated (EUH). The TOVA
  consisted of target-infrequent and target-frequent conditions, simulating
  static and dynamic (such as a basketball game) environments, respectively.
  TOVA measures included errors of omission (OE) and commission (CE), response
  time (RT), and sensitivity. RESULTS: During the target-infrequent half of
  test 3, EUH resulted in significantly better sensitivity (+0.4 ± 1.2 vs -0.9
  ± 1.3), faster RT (-8 ± 20 vs +16 ± 28), and fewer OE (-0.4 ± 0.7 vs +1.3
  ± 2.4) compared with DEH. During the target-frequent half, EUH resulted in
  significantly fewer OE (-4 ± 15 vs +5 ± 7) and CE (-1.9 ± 3.2 vs 0.6
  ±1.4)in test 2 and greater sensitivity (+0.7 ± 2.6 vs -0.7 ± 1.1) and
  faster RT (-21 ± 28 vs +5 ± 31) than DEH in test 3. CONCLUSION:
  Vigilance-related attention of male basketball players was impaired by DEH,
  especially during the target-frequent condition of the TOVA. These results
  suggest that fluid replacement is essential to prevent the decline in
  vigilance that occurs with DEH in highly dynamic environments. Therefore,
  basketball players should be advised to maintain EUH for optimal
  concentration and attentional skills during competition. ©2007The American
  College of Sports Medicine.%

    The effects of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid ingestion on men's
  cognitive performance were assessed. Eleven young men attended separate
  sessions in which each individual cycled in a controlled environment at 60\%
  of V̇O2max for periods of 15, 60, or 120 min without fluid replacement or
  120 min with fluid replacement. Immediately following the assigned submaximal
  exercise period, the participant completed a graded exercise test to
  voluntary exhaustion. An executive processing test and a short-term memory
  test were performed prior to and immediately following exercise.
  Choice-response times during the executive processing test decreased
  following exercise, regardless of the level of dehydration. Choice-response
  errors increased following exercise, but only on trials requiring set
  shifting. Short-term memory performance improved following exercise,
  regardless of the level of dehydration. Changes in cognitive performance
  following exercise are hypothesized to be related to metabolic arousal
  following strenuous physical activity. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.%

    Executive function is a collection of cognitive processes essential for
  higher order mental function. Processes involved in executive function
  include, but are not limited to, working memory, attention, cognitive
  flexibility, and impulse control. These complex behaviors are largely
  mediated by prefrontal cortical function but are modulated by dopaminergic,
  noradrenergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic input. The ability of these
  neurotransmitter systems to modulate executive function allows for adaption
  in cognitive behavior in response to changes in the environment. Because of
  the important role these neurotransmitter systems play in regulating
  executive function, changes in these systems can also have a grave impact on
  executive function. In addition, polymorphisms in genes associated with these
  neurotransmitters are associated with phenotypic differences in executive
  function. Understanding how these naturally occurring polymorphisms
  contribute to different executive function phenotypes will advance basic
  knowledge of cognition and potentially further understanding and treatment of
  mental illness that involve changes in executive function. In this review, we
  will examine the influence of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and
  acetylcholine on the following measures of executive function: attention,
  cognitive flexibility, and impulse control. We will also review the effects
  of polymorphisms in genes associated with these neurotransmitter systems on
  these measures of executive function.%

    In the laboratory, studies have shown an inconsistent pattern of whether,
  and how, mood may affect cognitive functions indicating both mood-related
  enhancement as well as decline. Surprisingly, little is known about whether
  there are similar effects in everyday life. Hence, the present study aimed to
  investigate possible mood effects on memory and executive control in a
  real-life situation. Mood effects were examined in the context of winning in
  a sports competition. Sixty-one male handball players were tested with an
  extensive cognitive test battery (comprising memory and executive control)
  both after winning a match and after training as neutral baseline. Mood
  differed significantly between the two testing situations, while
  physiological arousal and motivation were comparable. Results showed lowered
  performance after the win compared with training in selected cognitive
  measures. Specifically, short-term and episodic memory performance was poorer
  following a win, whereas executive control performance was unaffected by
  condition. Differences in memory disappeared when emotional states after the
  match were entered as covariates into the initial analyses. Thus, findings
  suggest mood-related impairments in memory, but not in executive control
  processes after a positive real-life event.%

    BACKGROUND: Well-recognized markers for static (one time) or dynamic
  (monitoring over time) dehydration assessment have not been rigorously tested
  for their usefulness in clinical, military, and sports medicine communities.
  OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the components of biological variation and
  the accuracy of potential markers in plasma, urine, saliva, and body mass
  (B(m)) for static and dynamic dehydration assessment. DESIGN: We studied 18
  healthy volunteers (13 men and 5 women) while carefully controlling hydration
  and numerous preanalytic factors. Biological variation was determined over 3
  consecutive days by using published methods. Atypical values based on
  statistical deviations from a homeostatic set point were examined. Measured
  deviations in body fluid were produced by using a separate, prospective
  dehydration experiment and evaluated by receiver operating characteristic
  (ROC) analysis to quantify diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: All dehydration
  markers displayed substantial individuality and one-half of the dehydration
  markers displayed marked heterogeneity of intraindividual variation. Decision
  levels for all dehydration markers were within one SD of the ROC criterion
  values, and most levels were nearly identical to the prospective group means
  after volunteers were dehydrated by 1.8-7.0\% of B(m). However, only plasma
  osmolality (P(osm)) showed statistical promise for use in the static
  dehydration assessment. A diagnostic decision level of 301 plusmn 5 mmol/kg
  was proposed. Reference change values of 9 mmol/kg (P(osm)), 0.010 [urine
  specific gravity (U(sg))], and 2.5\% change in B(m) were also statistically
  valid for dynamic dehydration assessment at the 95\% probability level.
  CONCLUSIONS: P(osm) is the only useful marker for static dehydration
  assessment. P(osm), U(sg), and B(m) are valid markers in the setting of
  dynamic dehydration assessment.%

    The purpose of this study was to quantify the variability and stability of
  1st morning body mass (BM) fluctuations during daily exercise in the heat
  while following traditional fluid intake guidance. Data from 65 men were
  examined retrospectively. BM fluctuations were monitored over 4 to 15
  consecutive days. Group daily variation in BM was 0.51+/-0.20 kg. Group
  coefficient of variation was 0.66+/-0.24\%, normally distributed, and not
  related to either absolute BM (r = 0.04) or number of measurements (r =
  0.34). Three days resulted in a similar variability estimate compared to 6 or
  9 d, although precision was improved with 9 d. In conclusion, 3 consecutive
  BM measurements provide an accurate assessment of daily BM variability, which
  is less than 1\% for active men when replacing 100\% of sweat losses during
  exercise. The data also suggest that daily BM is a sufficiently stable
  physiological parameter for potential daily fluid balance monitoring.%

    Investigated the effects of heat exposure, exercise-induced dehydration,
  and fluid ingestion on cognitive performance. Seven healthy men were kept
  euhydrated or were dehydrated by controlled passive exposure to heat (H) or
  by treadmill exercise (E) up to a weight loss of 2.8\%. On completion of a
  4-hr recovery, Ss drank a glucose/NaCl solution corresponding to 100\% of
  body weight loss induced by dehydration. (H1 and E1) or levels of fluid
  deficit were maintained (H0, E0). In the E0, H0, and control conditions, the
  S drank a solution containing the same quantity of glucose diluted in water.
  Tests of long- and short-term memory, perceptive discrimination, reaction
  time, and tracking were given 30 min after dehydration and 2 hrs after fluid
  ingestion. Both dehydration conditions impaired cognitive abilities
  (perceptive discrimination, short-term memory), as well as feelings of
  fatigue, without any relevant differences between the methods. By 3.5 hrs
  after fluid deficit, dehydration (H0 and E0) no longer had any adverse
  effect. Thus, there was no beneficial effect of fluid ingestion (H1 and El)
  on cognitive variables. However, long-term memory retrieval was impaired in
  both control and dehydration situations, whereas there was no performance
  decrement with fluid ingestion (H1, E1). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016

    Stimulating as well as detrimental effects of exercise on cognitive
  functioning have been reported. In the present study, 15 endurance-trained
  athletes (aged 18 to 42 years) performed a bicycle ergometer endurance test
  at 75\% of their maximal work capacity (Wmax). Psychomotor and cognitive
  tests were administered before and immediately after exercise. These
  consisted of simple reaction time (RT), 3-choice RT and Stimulus-Response
  (S-R) incompatible RT tasks, a finger-tapping task, and the Stroop test.
  Simple RT tasks, but also the more complex S-R in compatible RT, and Color
  Word Interference in the Stroop test showed an increase in speed of
  performance after exercise relative to baseline. An enhanced activation was
  probably responsible for this better performance on psychomotor and cognitive
  tests. Since performance on the most complex task, the Interference subtest
  of the Stroop, was especially improved after exercise, the expectancy of the
  subjects of a potential positive effect of exercise was thought to have been
  responsible.%

    The objective of this study was to examine the effect of fluid intake and
  possible dehydration on cognitive flight performance of pilots. A
  repeated-measures, counterbalanced, mixed study design was used to examine
  differences in working memory, spatial orientation, and cognitive flight
  performance of 40 randomly selected healthy pilots after having high and low
  fluid intakes. Serial weights were also analyzed to determine differences in
  cognitive flight performance of the dehydrated (1-3\% weight loss) and
  hydrated study participants. Results showed flight performance and spatial
  cognition test scores were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) poorer for
  pilots who had low fluid intakes and experienced dehydration in comparison to
  the hydrated pilots. These findings indicate fluid intake differences
  resulting in dehydration may have safety implications because peak cognitive
  performance among pilots is critical for flight safety.%

    Introduction Depending on type, intensity and duration, exercise can have
  both beneficial and detrimental effects on cognitive function. The impact of
  exercise on learning and memory is also sensitive to hydration status, so we
  hypothesized that mild hypohydration induced with exercise, will adversely
  impact executive and complex memory function tasks and that these changes in
  cognitive function are independent of changes in emotion. Methods Using a
  cross over design, on separate days 11 women exercised on a recumbent
  bicycle. On day 1, women exercised to 1.5\% hypohydration at 34 °C, and
  \&lt; 10\% rh, on day 2, water loss from sweating was replaced by drinking
  water (euhydration). Pre- and post-euhydration and hypohydration, subjects
  underwent computer based cognitive tasks (simple, learning, memory, executive
  function) and visual analog testing to determine emotion. Results Exercise
  increased Groton Maze Learning Test errors within both conditions: [Pre: 41.5
  ± 11.8, Post: 46.8 ± 12.4, and Pre: 41.9 ± 9.2, Post: 46.5 ± 12.9,
  hypohydrated and euhydrated, respectively, Pre vs Post, ANOVA, time effect, P
  = 0.007], a test of acquisition, storage, and use of new knowledge. None of
  the measures of emotion were affected by exercise under either hydration
  condition. Conclusions A bout of mild aerobic exercise compromised
  performance on a complex learning and memory task, but this change was
  unaffected by hydration status or emotion.%

    Limited information is available regarding the effects of mild dehydration
  on cognitive function. Therefore, mild dehydration was produced by
  intermittent moderate exercise without hyperthermia and its effects on
  cognitive function of women were investigated. Twenty-five females (age 23.0
  ± 0.6 y) participated in three 8-h, placebo-controlled experiments involving
  a different hydration state each day: exercise-induced dehydration with no
  diuretic (DN), exerciseinduced dehydration plus diuretic (DD; furosemide, 40
  mg), and euhydration (EU). Cognitive performance, mood, and symptoms of
  dehydration were assessed during each experiment, 3 times at rest and during
  each of 3 exercise sessions. The DN and DD trials in which a volunteer
  attained a ≥1\% level of dehydration were pooled and compared to that
  volunteer's equivalent EU trials. Mean dehydration achieved during these DN
  and DD trials was 21.36 ± 0.16\% of body mass. Significant adverse effects
  of dehydration were present at rest and during exercise for vigor-activity,
  fatigue-inertia, and total mood disturbance scores of the Profile of Mood
  States and for task difficulty, concentration, and headache as assessed by
  questionnaire. Most aspects of cognitive performance were not affected by
  dehydration. Serum osmolality, a marker of hydration, was greater in the mean
  of the dehydrated trials in which a ≥1\% level of dehydration was achieved
  (P = 0.006) compared to EU. In conclusion, degraded mood, increased
  perception of task difficulty, lower concentration, and headache symptoms
  resulted from 1.36\% dehydration in females. Increased emphasis on optimal
  hydration is warranted, especially during and after moderate exercise. ©

    Thirst was induced by rapid i.v. infusion of hypertonic saline (0.51 M at
  13.4 ml/min). Ten humans were neuroimaged by positron-emission tomography
  (PET) and four by functional MRI (fMRI). PET images were made 25 min after
  beginning infusion, when the sensation of thirst began to enter the stream of
  consciousness. The fMRI images were made when the maximum rate of increase of
  thirst occurred. The PET results showed regional cerebral blood flow changes
  similar to those delineated when thirst was maximal. These loci involved the
  phylogenetically ancient areas of the brain. fMRI showed activation in the
  anterior wall of the third ventricle, an area that is key in the genesis of
  thirst but is not an area revealed by PET imaging. Thus, this region plays as
  major a role in thirst for humans as for animals. Strong activations in the
  brain with fMRI included the anterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus,
  inferior and middle frontal gyri, insula, and cerebellum. When the subjects
  drank water to satiation, thirst declined immediately to baseline. A
  precipitate decline in intensity of activation signal occurred in the
  anterior cingulate area (Brodmann area 32) putatively related to
  consciousness of thirst. The intensity of activation in the anterior wall of
  the third ventricle was essentially unchanged, which is consistent with the
  fact that a significant time (15-20 min) would be needed before plasma Na
  concentration changed as a result of water absorption from the gut.%

    The relationship among changes in thirst sensations, blood variables, and
  differential fluid intake in hypohydrated humans was examined. Seven subjects
  were hypohydrated by 0\%, 3\%, 5\%, and 7\% of their body weight on four
  separate trials which were systematically randomized between subjects.
  Hypohydration levels were achieved with a regimen of restricted food and
  fluid intake and moderate heat-exercise stress. Statistically significant
  linear and quadratic trends were found for the intensity of several
  sensations with progressive hypohydration levels. In general, plasma
  osmolality and renin activity increased and plasma volume decreased with
  increasing hypohydration levels. During a one hour period of ad lib drinking,
  all subjects consumed insufficient fluid to rehydrate back to baseline body
  weights. Using regression analyses, fluid intake was predicted by the
  magnitude of subjective and physiological indices of hypohydration. Results
  demonstrate that both hypovolemia and plasma osmolality contribute
  significantly to fluid intake in hypohydrated humans. The results also
  indicate that thirst sensations make a substantial contribution to
  differential fluid intake in humans.%

    The primary aims of this paper were to examine the effect of heat stress on
  working memory, choice reaction time and mood state, and to investigate the
  relationship between heat induced changes in plasma concentrations of
  selected neurotransmitters and hormones, and cognition. Heat stress resulted
  in a deterioration of performance on a central executive task (random
  movement generation) but not on verbal and spatial recall, and choice
  reaction time tasks. Perceptions of vigour decreased and fatigue increased
  following exposure to heat stress. Plasma concentrations of cortisol and
  5-hydroxytryptamine significantly increased following exposure to heat.
  Regression analyses showed that percent body mass loss and change from
  baseline (Δ) concentrations of cortisol, post-exposure to heat, were
  significant predictors of Δ random movement generation and Δ fatigue. A
  secondary purpose was to examine the effect of recovery on cognition and
  mood. Following recovery, the performance of the central executive task was
  poorer than pre-treatment. Mood states, catecholamines and
  5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations returned to pre-treatment values, but
  cortisol fell to a level significantly lower. Regression correlations showed
  that Δ adrenaline and Δ scores, post-recovery, on the central executive
  task were significantly correlated. Δ noradrenaline correlated significantly
  with Δ fatigue. It was concluded that heat stress results in deterioration
  in the performance of central executive tasks and perceptions of mood state,
  and that this can be predicted by changes in body mass loss and plasma
  concentrations of the hormones cortisol and adrenaline.%

    Context: Dehydration and concussion are common in athletic performance.
  Some experts have speculated that dehydration may negatively influence
  performance on tests commonly used for concussion assessment. Objective: To
  determine how the signs and symptoms, neuropsychological performance, and
  postural stability are affected by dehydration. Design: Repeated-measures
  design assessing subjects in the euhydrated and dehydrated conditions.
  Setting: Sports Medicine Research Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants:
  Twenty-four healthy, male recreational athletes participated in the study.
  Intervention(s): Subjects participated in 2 counterbalanced sessions
  (euhydrated and dehydrated) separated by at least 7 days. Subjects were
  dehydrated using fluid restriction and an exercise task. No direct
  intervention was provided for the euhydrated condition. Main Outcome
  Measure(s): We used the Standardized Assessment of Concussion to test mental
  status, the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) to
  evaluate neuropsychological performance, the NeuroCom Sensory Organization
  Test and Balance Error Scoring System to test postural stability, the Graded
  Symptom Checklist to assess symptom presence and severity in our
  participants, and urine specific gravity and body mass to determine hydration
  status. Results: No differences were noted for the Standardized Assessment of
  Concussion, total Balance Error Scoring System errors, composite Sensory
  Organization Test, and composite ANAM scores between conditions. Subjects in
  the dehydrated condition had significant deterioration in visual memory
  (t₂₃ = 2.130, P {\textless} .001) and fatigue measures (t₂₃ = -7.880,
  P {\textless} .001) as assessed by ANAM. The dehydrated condition resulted in
  subjects reporting a significantly higher number (t₂₃ = -8.585, P
  {\textless} .001) and severity (t₂₃ = -7.673, P {\textless} .001) of
  symptoms than the euhydrated subjects on the Graded Symptom Checklist.
  Conclusions: Our results suggest that moderate dehydration (-2.5 ± 0.63\%)
  significantly influenced the self-report of symptoms commonly associated with
  concussion. Dehydration resulted in a deterioration of visual memory and
  increases in the self-report of fatigue. Despite these findings, dehydration
  did not affect other neuropsychological and postural stability objective
  testing measures for concussion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all

    Eight healthy men, unacclimated to heat, were submitted to variations in
  body hydration. The subjects were kept euhydrated, dehydrated by controlled
  passive hyperthermia or exercise on a treadmill up to a weight loss of 2.8\%,
  or hyperhydrated using a solution containing glycerol, with a total ingested
  volume equal to 21.4 ml/kg of body weight. On completion of a 90-min recovery
  period, the subjects were assigned a pedaling exercise on an arm-crank
  ergometer. Psychological tests were administered 30 min after the phase of
  hydration variation and 15 min after the arm crank exercise. Both dehydration
  conditions impaired cognitive abilities (i.e., perceptive discrimination,
  psycho-motor skills, and short-term memory) as well as subjective estimates
  of fatigue, without any relevant differences between them. Short-term memory
  was significantly greater following hyperhydration when compared to
  euhydration (P {\textless} .05). Following arm crank exercise, further
  effects of dehydration were found for tracking performance only (P
  {\textless} .05). Moreover, long-term memory was impaired in both control and
  dehydration situations, whereas there was no decrement in performance in the
  hyperhydration condition.%

    The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of
  carbohydrate-electrolyte solution (CE), lemon tea (LT), and distilled water
  (DW) on rehydration and cognitive performance after 60 min of moderate
  exercise. 9 healthy males and 10 eumenorrheic females completed 3 runs in a
  randomized crossover study design. During the 4-h recovery (REC) period, they
  consumed either a volume of CE, LT or DW equal to 150\% of their body mass
  (BM) loss during the previous run. The 3 beverages vary in carbohydrate and
  electrolyte content. A battery of cognitive tests was performed upon arrival,
  immediately after exercise, and at the end of REC. After the REC, the
  restoration of BM loss was lower in the DW and LT trials than that in the CE
  trial in the female participants (CE vs. LT vs. DW: 59.3±2.8 vs. 41.7±5.7
  vs. 45.6±2.2\%). When compared with the DW, the accuracy of performances
  during a working memory task in both males and females was higher in the CE
  and LT trials. The results suggested that during a short-term recovery, both
  LT and CE show certain beneficial effect in maintaining cognitive
  performance. However, CE appears to be more effective than LT and DW in
  rehydrating female participants.%

    Effect of acute mild dehydration on cognitive-motor performance in golf. J
  Strength Cond Res 26(11): 3075-3080, 2012-Whether mild dehydration (21 to 3\%
  body mass change [DBM]) impairs neurophysiological function during
  sport-specific cognitive-motor performance has yet to be fully elucidated. To
  investigate this within a golfing context, 7 low-handicap players (age: 21 6
  1.1 years; mass: 76.1 6 11.8 kg; stature: 1.77 6 0.07 m; handicap: 3.0 6 1.2)
  completed a golf-specific motor and cognitive performance task in a
  euhydrated condition (EC) and dehydrated condition (DC) (randomized
  counterbalanced design; 7-day interval). Dehydration was controlled using a
  previously effective 12-hour fluid restriction, monitored through DBM and
  urine color assessment (UCOL). Mild dehydration reduced the mean BM by 1.5 6
  0.5\% (p = 0.01), with UCOL increasing from 2 (EC) to 4 (DC) (p = 0.02). Mild
  dehydration significantly impaired motor performance, expressed as shot
  distance (114.6 vs. 128.6 m; p , 0.001) and off-Target accuracy (7.9 vs. 4.1
  m; p = 0.001). Cognitive performance, expressed as the mean error in distance
  judgment to target increased from 4.16 3.0 m (EC) to 8.86 4.7 m (DC) (p ,
  0.001). The findings support those of previous research that indicates mild
  dehydration (21 to 2\% DBM) significantly impairs cognitive-motor task
  performance. This study is the first to show that mild dehydration can impair
  distance, accuracy, and distance judgment during golf performance. © 2012

    O objetivo desse estudo foi avaliar o estado de hidratação e desempenho
  cognitivo-motor em atletas durante uma prova de fast triathlon no calor. Doze
  triatletas (34 ± 2,7 anos) participaram do trabalho. O estado de
  hidratação foi mensurado pela perda de massa corporal (MC), coloração e
  gravidade específica (GE) urinárias. O desempenho cognitivo-motor foi
  verificado pela coordenação motora (CM) e tempo de reação simples (TRS).
  Após a prova houve uma diminuição significativa da MC (1,8 \%; P
  {\textless} 0,001). Um aumento significativo entre pré e pós-competição
  foi observado para o índice de coloração da urina (P {\textless} 0,001) e
  GE (P {\textless} 0,001), respectivamente. O TRS foi melhor após a prova.
  Porém, demonstraram dismetria, prejudicando sua CM. Conclui-se que níveis
  de desidratação foram observados entre os atletas após a prova.
  Alterações opostas foram encontradas quanto ao desempenho cognitivo-motor.
  Atletas demonstraram uma maior descoordenação motora, mas melhoraram seu
  tempo de reação.Palavras-Chave: Desempenho atlético; Desidratação; Tempo

    There is a great demand for perceptual effort ratings in order to better
  understand man at work. Such ratings are important complements to behavioral
  and physiological measurements of physical performance and work capacity.
  This is true for both theoretical analysis and application in medicine, human
  factors, and sports. Perceptual estimates, obtained by psychophysical
  ratio-scaling methods, are valid when describing general perceptual
  variation, but category methods are more useful in several applied situations
  when differences between individuals are described. A presentation is made of
  ratio-scaling methods, category methods, especially the Borg Scale for
  ratings of perceived exertion, and a new method that combines the category
  method with ratio properties. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of the
  different methods are discussed in both theoretical-psychophysical and
