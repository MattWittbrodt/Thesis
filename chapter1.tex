\chapter{Introduction and Background}
There are reasons to believe body water deficits (hypohydration; HYPO) can have adversely impact central nervous system (CNS) function. Severe levels of HYPO (e.g., prolonged water restriction in the desert) elicit symptoms of CNS dysfunction such as decreased mental alertness, personality changes (e.g., hostility), and headaches \cite{adolf_physiology_1947, king_brief_1878}. However, at more modest states of HYPO, the effects on the CNS are less clear. For example, certain populations (e.g., elderly) may be at greater risk for confusion and delirium with HYPO, leading to increased frequency, duration, and severity of hospitalizations \cite{inouye_delirium_2006,warren_burden_1994}. Furthermore, small to moderate levels of HYPO may also degrade human-system performance reliant on adequate CNS function, as evidenced by impaired driving ability \cite{watson_mild_2015} and performance during occupation-specific simulations (e.g., pilot proficiency) \cite{lindseth_effects_2013}. Indirect evidence also suggests occupational accident rates are increased during hot weather/summer months when HYPO is likely \cite{kenefick_hydration_2007, kenefick_dehydration_2012}. Lastly, some have suggested that the acute act of drinking water (when marginal body water deficits of ${<}$ 1\% body mass (BM) loss) can improve memory in both school children and adults \cite{benton_effect_2009,benton_small_2015,benton_minor_2016,fadda_effects_2012}. However, despite these numerous observations, the published peer-reviewed literature remains inconsistent regarding whether moderate HYPO impairs CNS function \cite{ely_hypohydration_2013,adam_hydration_2008,danci_voluntary_2009}, which CNS functions may be most susceptible to HYPO, and what magnitude of HYPO can be tolerated before decrements in cognitive task performance occur.

\section{Physiological Responses to Hypohydration}
Hypohydration elicits severe consequences to physiological homeostasis \cite{iom_dietary_2004}. In the body, water is stored within three compartments: plasma (8\% of total body water), interstitial fluid (25\%), and intracellular fluid (67\%) (Figure \ref{fig:fluidVolumes}) \cite{sawka_thermoregulatory_1985}, with water transfer among these compartments largely governed by Starling forces (capillary and/or osmotic exchange). The mechanism of fluid lost (e.g., sweating or diarrhea) influences the osmotic gradient and, therefore, dictates physiological responses to HYPO. Because these physiological responses vary in their sensitivity, HYPO is classified as either intracellular or extracellular \cite{cheuvront_dehydration:_2014}. Intracellular HYPO occurs via water losses through non-illness or non-medicinal interventions such as exercise, heat stress, or fluid restriction. Conversely, extracellular HYPO occurs when the fluid lost is isotonic to blood plasma, as observed within diarrhea or usage of diuretics \cite{cheuvront_dehydration:_2014,cheuvront_mechanisms_2010}.

	\label{fig:fluidVolumes}
\end{figure}

HYPO elicited by exercise-heat stress (EHS) results in intracellular hypohydration. During EHS, elevations in sweat rate (a byproduct of increased metabolic heat production from the exercising muscles) \cite{sawka_integrated_2011} results in marked losses of sweat (i.e., hypovolemia), which is hypotonic fluid to blood plasma (i.e., less solute for given volume). Therefore, more relative water is lost compared to solute, which results in a hypertonic blood plasma. Because cellular membranes are permeable to water and osmotic gradients facilitate movement from high to low concentration, water moves from the interstitial/intracellular compartments into the blood plasma \cite{cheuvront_dehydration:_2014,costill_muscle_1976,darrow_changes_1935}. When extracellular fluid osmolality increases by 2\%, CNS osmoreceptors for anti-diuretic hormone and angiotensin II and thirst depolarize \cite{bourque_central_2008}, resulting in water conservation and drive for water acquisition \cite{andreoli_endocrine_2010}. Intracellular HYPO initiates a physiological response at much lower levels of body water loss than extracellular HYPO. During extracellular HYPO, the hypovolemia (i.e., from diarrhea) is isotonic to blood plasma. As a result, osmoreceptors are not depolarized and physiological compensation only occurs when baroreceptors sense a $>$10\% loss in blood volume \cite{cheuvront_dehydration:_2014}.

Resulting from the previously described physiological perturbations, HYPO may impair aspects of physical performance. HYPO of ${\geq}$2\% body mass (BM) loss appears to be the threshold eliciting aerobic performance impairments \cite{sawka_hypohydration_2015}, however degradations have been reported at -1\% BM loss \cite{bardis_mild_2013}. Furthermore, aerobic exercise performance following HYPO (as measured by time trial or time to exhaustion tests) appears to be more robustly degraded in warm/hot environments \cite{sawka_human_1992,cheuvront_mechanisms_2010,ebert_influence_2007} when body water deficits occur with exacerbated cardiovascular strain \cite{costill_plasma_1974,cheuvront_mechanisms_2010} and high skin temperature \cite{sawka_high_2012}. For example, HYPO does not appear to impair aerobic exercise performance until skin temperature exceeds ${\sim}$27${^o}$C, with performance impairments of 1.3\% occurring with each 1${^o}$C increase thereafter \cite{sawka_high_2012,kenefick_skin_2010}. While aerobic exercise performance is impaired by HYPO, the impact of HYPO on muscular strength is less convincing. A recent review article found almost unanimous agreement that HYPO impairs aerobic endurance performance at ${\geq}$4\% BM loss (19/21 studies or 90\%), but only 19\% (25/133 studies) observed impairments in muscular power \cite{cheuvront_dehydration:_2014}. A subsequent meta-analysis \cite{savoie_effect_2015} reported significant performance degradations of HYPO on muscular endurance (8.3\%), muscular power (5.5\%), but not anaerobic capacity (3.5\% performance drop). This follows experimental evidence which has observed greater performance impairments to muscular endurance (e.g., submaximal contraction time to fatigue) compared to muscular power (e.g., maximal voluntary contraction) \cite{bigard_effects_2001}. Lastly, HYPO may also impair intermittent exercise, as observed with decreases to physical performance in team sports (e.g., soccer) \cite{nuccio_fluid_2017}.

\section{Hypohydration and Brain Anatomy}
The effect of HYPO on mammalian brain anatomy has been examined for the last 160 years. The original thought was that physiological mechanisms were sufficient to maintain CNS water homeostasis. Simple autopsy measurements of animal organ weight/volume changes revealed that muscle and skin weights were decreased following HYPO \cite{nothwang_folgen_1892,falck_untersuchungen_1854,schiff_experimentelle_1925}, but brain mass was not necessarily affected \cite{falck_untersuchungen_1854}. More recently, one study in rats corroborated these early findings by observing that, although organ water content decreased following total body water losses of ${\sim}$16\%, total brain water increased by ${\sim}$2\% via expansion of both intra- and extracellular fluid volumes \cite{nose_distribution_1983}. 

Until recently, the ability to image and analyze an \textit{in vivo} human brain has not been available. As a result, the first usage of this technology to scan the human brain following HYPO occurred in 2005 \cite{dickson_effects_2005, duning_dehydration_2005}. However, these two studies found different results, with one observing no differences in brain volume following HYPO of -1.6\% BM \cite{dickson_effects_2005}, but the other finding a significant decrease in total brain volume \cite{duning_dehydration_2005} (Table \ref{tbl:mri_deh}). In total, eight studies have investigated the effects of HYPO on brain morphology (Table \ref{tbl:mri_deh}), with most reporting changes in total brain volume and/or lateral ventricle size. Only one study has observed decreases in total brain volume following HYPO, with a 16h fluid restriction protocol (1.6 \% body mass (BM) loss) decreasing brain volume by ${\sim}$0.5\%, although it should be noted individual responses ranged from +0.2 to -2.4\% \cite{duning_dehydration_2005}. The authors attributed decreased brain volume to the osmotic gradient induced by hypertonic hypovolemia shrinking the astrocytes which compromised fluid movement within the brain \cite{duning_dehydration_2005}. However, this study is at odds with other studies reporting no changes in total brain volume with HYPO ranging from 0.8 - 2.9 \% body mass (BM) loss \cite{watson_effect_2010,kempton_effects_2009,kempton_dehydration_2011,meyers_does_2016}.

Many studies have attempted to determine changes within the lateral ventricles following HYPO, as these structures are both the largest component of the ventricular system (i.e., repository for brain water) and a prominent/distinguishable brain landmark. However, unlike total brain volume, these data are more divergent. While some studies have observed no significant difference \cite{meyers_does_2016, dickson_effects_2005, streitburger_investigating_2012,meyers_does_2016,dickson_effects_2005}, others have reported either an increase \cite{kempton_dehydration_2011,kempton_effects_2009} or decrease \cite{watson_effect_2010} in lateral ventricular volume following HYPO. Furthermore, some have suggested that lateral ventricle volume expansion significantly correlates to BM loss \cite{kempton_dehydration_2011, dickson_effects_2005}, suggesting magnitude of body water loss could elicit a graded increase in lateral ventricular volume. However, in both instances, these correlations were observed over a small range of HYPO (${\sim}$1\%). Furthermore, ventricular volume changes had a wide dispersion ($>$14\%) relative to body water deficits and both studies had some subjects with ventricular expansion and some with ventricular shrinkage following HYPO. While some have suggested ventricular expansion occurs from shrinking astrocytes limiting fluid movement throughout the brain \cite{kempton_dehydration_2011}, the mechanism for these changes is still unclear.

While multiple studies have presented data regarding potential brain ventricle volume changes following HYPO, the impact of body water deficits on other brain structures has received less attention. Following HYPO, Streitburger et al. \cite{streitburger_investigating_2012} observed decreased white and grey matter volumes in areas surrounding the brain ventricles when compared to when subjects hyperhydrated (i.e., consumed water in excess). Although these are intriguing findings, the small sample size (n = 6) and little control for baseline hydration status may be limiting factors. Furthermore, the voxel-based morphology approach did not allow for individual brain structures segmentation, and therefore further information about brain areas possibly susceptible to HYPO cannot be determined. Therefore, this thesis attempted to increase both sample size, magnitude of HYPO, and the parcellation of individual brain areas to better investigate the effects of HYPO on brain structures. 

\section{Cellular Mechanisms of Central Water Homeostasis}
Given the heterogeneity in observed changes to brain ventricles following HYPO, questions have arisen regarding a potential mechanism resulting in findings. Although osmoregulation occurs via activation of both peripheral (e.g., those within the digestive tract) and central osmoreceptors (e.g., those within the brain) \cite{bourque_central_2008}. The primary central osmoreceptors are located in brain areas without presence of a blood-brain barrier, the circumventricular organs, specifically the \textit{organum vasculosum laminae terminalis} (OVLT), which sits at the base of the third ventricle \cite{bourque_central_2008}. As the OVLT is exposed to hypertonic fluid, the cellular volume shrinks (intracellular HYPO), leading to a depolarized state of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptors \cite{ciura_hypertonicity_2011} and increased action potential encoding \cite{bourque_central_2008}. Secondly, although not strictly osmoreceptors, many cellular types show osmoreceptive properties. Glial cells, specifically astrocytes, aid in regulating brain water and ion homeostasis in addition to maintaining the blood brain barrier are involved in the maintenance of the blood–brain barrier \cite{simard_neurobiology_2004}. Following the sensing of hypertonicity within the blood, arginine vasopressin (AVP) is released both systemically (to the body) and centrally (to the brain) \cite{simard_neurobiology_2004}. AVP therefore acts upon astrocytes to accomplish two things: i) influx of Na${^+}$, K${^+}$, and Cl${^-}$, ii) over-expression of aquaporin 4 to allow influx of water \cite{simard_neurobiology_2004}.   

These osmoprotective mechanisms (e.g., ion pumps, leak channels) are particularly robust within the brain, which maintains total volume despite large body water losses \cite{nose_distribution_1983,cipolla_cerebral_2009,cserr_extracellular_1991}. The brain, unlike other body tissues, does not allow water influx by Starling forces, as the presence of high electrical resistance tight junctions (${\sim}$100x greater than capillaries) within the blood brain barrier (BBB) prevent movement of electrolytes and other hydrophilic substances \cite{kimelberg_water_2004,cipolla_cerebral_2009,ropper_hyperosmolar_2012,bain_cerebral_2015}. These protective mechanisms are also bolstered by astrocytes, which assist in maintaining structural integrity of the tight junctions, regulating ionic homeostasis, and buffering K${^+}$ \cite{cipolla_cerebral_2009}. Secondly, the brain produces organic osmolytes (myo-inositol, betaine, taurine, sorbitol) which help preserve cellular volume by increasing ionic concentration within the cell, equilibrating the osmotic gradient with the hypertonic exterior \cite{de_petris_cell_2001,weed_pressure_1919}. During chronic (7 d) hypertonicity (extracellular osmolality greater than intracellular osmolality), organic osmolytes accounted for 35\% of brain tonicity (with no change in brain water content) \cite{lien_effects_1990} and were up-regulated by 44\% in an infant suffering severe HYPO \cite{lee_organic_1994}. However, because organic osmolyte gene encoding occurs following sensing of hypertonicity, appearance within the brain tissue is delayed \cite{de_petris_cell_2001, gullans_control_1993}. As a result, osmolyte-mediated equilibration of neuronal water content does not occur immediately following acute exposure to hypertonic environment \cite{ayus_effects_1996}. Therefore, although humans may be protected against large brain water perturbations, the delayed time course of osmolyte production may result in vulnerabilities to brain water homeostasis during acute HYPO as elicited by exercise-heat stress.

\section{Cognitive-Motor Responses to Hypohydration}
Psychological/cognitive-motor impairments were observed in soldiers under severe physical distress \cite{adolf_physiology_1947,king_brief_1878}. While more recent research has confirmed cognitive-motor deficits under adverse physiological stress (e.g., sleep deprivation, HYPO) using more sophisticated instrumentation \cite{lieberman_severe_2005}, the more pertinent question remains understanding the potential impairments in cognitive-motor performance following HYPO magnitudes likely to be encountered during normal military/occupational/athletic scenarios \cite{sawka_american_2007}. Four early studies were seemingly the first to examine the specific effects of HYPO on cognitive performance, observing mixed results \cite{bijlani_effect_1980,sharma_differential_1983,sharma_influence_1986,gopinathan_role_1988}. Three of these studies suggested cognitive-motor functions of mental arithmetic, executive function, and information processing were impaired at moderate levels of HYPO (-2\% BM), with some suggestions that an increased magnitude of HYPO (-4\% BM) resulted in further cognitive-motor deterioration \cite{gopinathan_role_1988} in hot conditions \cite{sharma_differential_1983,sharma_influence_1986}.    

Following these early studies, various levels of HYPO, and methods to induce HYPO have been utilized across a number of investigations without largely equivocal findings. While most review articles suggest variability in study design largely explains the disparate literature \cite{masento_effects_2014,grandjean_dehydration_2007}, studies controlling for some of these variables have not always supported this claim. For example, when HYPO magnitude was controlled (2.8\%), HYPO induced by both exercise heat stress and heat stress alone deteriorated short term memory and perceptive discrimination \cite{cian_influence_2000}. This study was followed up a year later \cite{cian_effects_2001} with similar findings with additional perceptual measures which suggested HYPO elevated fatigue during the cognitive-motor battery. How other HYPO methods (e.g., fluid restriction vs exercise-heat stress) compare and potentially impact cognitive-motor responses following body water deficits merits further investigation.

Cognitive-motor task/domain selection may be a larger contributor to the wide variation within the previous literature. Most previous studies employed a multi-modal cognitive-motor battery assessing a wide array of cognitive-motor domains (e.g., executive function, working memory, reaction time, information processing). As a result, there are commonly observed within-study discrepancies, with some aspects of cognitive-motor function being impaired while others remain unaffected \cite{ganio_mild_2011}. While these results may suggest some cognitive-motor domains are more affected by water deficits than others, no concrete mechanism has elucidated why HYPO may impair cognitive-motor performance. One common suggestion is that HYPO may impair the higher-order cognitive-motor functions (e.g., executive functions). Evidence for this has been observed previously \cite{tomporowski_effects_2007}, with the more difficult variation of an executive function showing greater errors than the less complex variation. However, across the literature, this idea has not always been supported. Executive functions (e.g., working memory, executive function, inhibitory control) have not been uniformly impaired across all studies \cite{wittbrodt_exercise-induced_2015,armstrong_mild_2012,danci_voluntary_2009,kakos_improving_2013,turner_mild_2017}, however, it should be noted that some of these previous studies elicited modest levels of HYPO ($<$2\% BM loss). Furthermore, some have observed decrements in lower level tasks, such as simple reaction time \cite{barroso_hydration_2014,mcmorris_heat_2006}, indicating cognitive-motor performance impairments are likely not isolate to ``complex'' tasks.

Recently, some investigations have attempted to better understand the potential mechanisms of how HYPO may impair cognitive-motor function by employing neuroimaging techniques. The first such investigation \cite{szinnai_effect_2005} utilized electroencephelography (EEG) and assessed auditory event-related potentials (P300) with an oddball paradigm. Measuring three central electrodes on the frontal, central, and parietal regions, there was no impact of HYPO (2.6\% BM loss) on either latency or amplitude of the auditory event-related potentials \cite{szinnai_effect_2005}. However, despite no changes in EEG responses, subjects did report increased levels of effort and concentration required to complete the cognitive-motor tasks following HYPO, suggesting the tasks were more strenuous although not to the extent of impairing function or performance \cite{szinnai_effect_2005}. 

Following this initial study, others have employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to further examine the effects of HYPO on cognitive-motor performance and function. fMRI has the benefit of added spatial resolution along with the ability to investigate activations within cortical and subcortical brain areas \cite{mehta_neuroergonomics:_2013}, which may allow better understanding of a potential mechanism by which HYPO may impair cognitive-motor performance. One study has investigated blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses to a cognitive-motor task following HYPO \cite{kempton_dehydration_2011}. During an executive-function task (Tower of London), HYPO (1.6\% BM loss) elicited increased BOLD responses within fronto-parietal regions \cite{kempton_dehydration_2011}. However, HYPO did not alter executive-function task performance \cite{kempton_dehydration_2011}, and therefore the authors suggested elevated BOLD following HYPO indicate inefficient neural processing which might not be reflected in behavioral impairments. More recently, another EEG study \cite{watson_mild_2015} suggested alpha (8-11 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) power within the motor brain regions (C3, C4 electrodes) may be increased following marginal HYPO (1.1\% BM loss) during a prolonged, monotonous, driving task. This was coupled with an increase in errors following HYPO, suggesting that, over an extended (120 min) period, HYPO may increase the neural resource requirement leading to impaired performance. However, given the analysis within the previous study, it is difficult to elucidate whether this increase in brain activation is related to increased effort, task-related impairments, or another mechanism. Lastly, one study has examined the effects of HYPO on pain-evoked-activations (cold presser test) with fMRI \cite{ogino_dehydration_2014}. HYPO elicited greater BOLD responses within the anterior cingulate, insula, and thalamus compared to controlled conditions along with a decreased pain threshold, suggesting somatosensory function may also be altered. Taken together, these initial neuroimaging studies have begun to suggest HYPO may alter neural resource requirements/activation patterns during cognitive-motor or sensory tasks as a mechanism by which body water deficits affects cognitive-motor function and performance.

\section{Hypohydration and Visuomotor Function}
Within studies assessing cognitive-motor responses to HYPO, cognitive-motor performance is typically assessed with a computerized task requiring subjects to produce a movement (e.g., button press) and therefore activating the visuomotor system. While the primary and supplementary motor cortices were once believed to govern motor movement, more recent evidence suggests these areas also respond to the presentation of visual stimuli within the frontal eye field \cite{fadiga_visuomotor_2000}. The entire visuomotor system consists of a multitude of fronto-parietal brain areas (prefontal cortex, supplementary eye field, frontal eye field, primary motor cortex), subcortical structures (thalamus, basal ganglia, hippocampus), and the cerebellum which combine to encode a motor program to facilitate completion of an action (e.g., pressing of button) \cite{murray_role_2000}. This thesis will further explore visuomotor timing during simple, externally paced finger tapping tasks. Within these visually paced tasks (e.g., responding to a blinking light), researchers have primarily been interested in the timing mechanisms and potential influences \cite{ruspantini_considerations_2011}. The tasks can take many variations including the number of fingers required, nature of stimulus (visual or auditory), and whether the pacing is external (e.g., stimulus on screen) or internal (e.g., tapping at an internally-driven rhythm) \cite{witt_functional_2008}. Furthermore, the performance effects can also widely vary based on the frequency of tapping \cite{bove_effects_2007}.

Broadly, the production of a motor response occurs in two phases: motor planning and motor execution \cite{crammond_prior_2000}. Motor planning consists of the cognitive steps involved before movement occurs: observing the environment (i.e., stimulus identification), integrating task rules (i.e., if stimulus is red, press right button), determining the motor goal (i.e., press right button), and the abstract kinematics (i.e., how to move right) \cite{wong_motor_2015}. It is believed motor planning, because of the information processing involved, dictates the measured reaction time within visuomotor studies \cite{wong_motor_2015}. Although motor planning and execution are presented here as occurring in serially, some have suggested neurons within the primary motor cortex and dorsal premotor cortex may contribute simultaneous to both motor planning and motor execution \cite{crammond_prior_2000}. Motor execution is the initiation of a movement to accomplish the motor goal \cite{kaufman_roles_2013}. Motor responses occur via integration of the motor thalamus, basal ganglia (globus pallidus internus, substantia nigra pars reticulata), cerebellum, and the associative, premotor, and motor areas of the cerebral cortex (Figure \ref{fig:motor_thalamus} \cite{rizzolatti_organization_1998,bosch-bouju_motor_2013}. Within motor execution, it appears that the motor thalamus is integral to integrating various pieces of information (e.g., motor program, temporal pattern, motivation, action selection, action selection) to select/execute the correct motor movement \cite{bosch-bouju_motor_2013}. However, the thalamus has a large well establish sensory role with integrations from the visual cortex along with mediating arousal, attention, and other sensory stimuli \cite{nakajima_thalamic_2017}. Because HYPO elicits well-defined deleterious perceptual changes \cite{engell_thirst_1987,armstrong_mild_2012,lieberman_severe_2005}, the thalamus, and thus visuomotor function, could be uniquely challenged by body water deficits.

\end{figure}

Despite this potential risk for visuomotor impairments by thalamus overload (or other neurophysiological mechanism), previous research has not systematically investigated the effects of HYPO on motor planning and motor execution. Furthermore, no study has previously examined how visuomotor brain areas (motor cortex, supplementary motor cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, parietal cortex) are impacted by HYPO. Previous research has examined some components of visuomotor function (Figure \ref{tbl:m_c_studies}), however, the results are not clear. One example of this discrepancy in the literature occurred in two studies from the same lab \cite{cian_effects_2001,cian_influence_2000}. Using an identical HYPO protocol, magnitude of HYPO, and unstable tracking task, one study reported impaired motor coordination \cite{cian_influence_2000} while the subsequent study did not \cite{cian_effects_2001}. Despite the equivocal literature, reports of slowed visuomotor reaction time \cite{wong_effects_2014} and decreased motor coordination accuracy \cite{sharma_influence_1986,cian_influence_2000} have been observed following HYPO, suggesting both motor planning and motor execution may be impaired. Changes within visuomotor task performance may manifest/contribute to deteriorations in skilled task performance, which has been previously observed \cite{baker_progressive_2007,smith_effect_2012,nuccio_fluid_2017}.

\section{Research Aims}
Hypohydration is known to impair performance in athletic / occupational / military environments \cite{iom_dietary_2004}, however, the effects on cognitive-motor performance are much less understood. Cognitive-motor performance is typically assessed with a computerized task where subjects produce a movement (e.g., button press), requiring activation of the areas involved in creating a motor response (i.e., visuomotor system). However, to date, the effect of HYPO on visuomotor performance is unclear. Furthermore, relatively few studies have integrated any neuroimaging measures during the performance of cognitive tests following HYPO (and none during visuomotor tasks) \cite{kempton_dehydration_2011,watson_mild_2015,szinnai_effect_2005}, providing minimal evidence regarding body water deficits and resulting brain function. By testing the following specific aims, we evaluated how HYPO impacts brain structure along with performance and function in visuomotor tasks emphasizing the two phases of visuomotor function: motor planning and motor execution.

In Chapter 2, we address research \textbf{Aim 1: To systematically review the literature and examine factors influencing effect size of HYPO on cognitive-motor functions via meta-analysis}. Based on conclusions from multiple review articles \cite{masento_effects_2014,lieberman_hydration_2007,grandjean_dehydration_2007}, it is still unclear: i) whether hypohydration impairs cognitive-motor performance and ii) what the mechanism relating to these potential impairments. To assess this, a systematic review will be completed along with scanning of pertinent review articles to collect all studies examining the effects of HYPO on cognitive-motor performance. All cognitive-motor tasks will be classified into specific domains (e.g., working memory, reaction time, attention) based upon a previously published categorization protocol \cite{chang_effects_2012}. Further study information will be captured and analyzed such as the method to elicit hypohydration, level of hypohydration achieved, subject demographics, subject fitness level, and duration from end of hypohydration intervention to cognitive-motor testing (during exercise-based hypohydration interventions). 

Previous literature has suggested that, if HYPO does impair cognitive-motor performance, the decrements will be small - similar to the effect observed with other nutritional interventions \cite{masento_effects_2014}. Therefore, \textit{we hypothesize hypohydration will elicit a small, but significant, adverse affect on cognitive-motor performance}. Secondly, previous literature has also suggested cognitive-motor impairments are associated with magnitude of HYPO, as evidenced by studies observing exacerbated cognitive-motor decrements with increased body water losses  \cite{gopinathan_role_1988,sharma_influence_1986}. Furthermore, narrative reviews have concluded cognitive-motor decrements are more likely at larger (3-4\%) body water losses \cite{nuccio_fluid_2017}, and therefore \textit{we hypothesize cognitive-motor impairments will have a negative association with body mass loss}. Lastly, others have hypothesized that higher-order cognitive-motor functions will be impaired to a greater extent than less complex functions \cite{tomporowski_effects_2007,nuccio_fluid_2017}. This belief is evidenced by increased performance decrements on the more challenging version of an executive function task following HYPO \cite{tomporowski_effects_2007}. \textit{We hypothesize that hypohydration will impair executive functions to a greater extent than lower-level cognitive-motor domains (e.g., simple reaction time)}.

In Chapter 3, we address \textbf{Research Aim 2: To examine the effect of exercise-heat stress with and without fluid replacement on brain structure, function, and visuomotor performance}. While the literature presents disparate findings (Table \ref{tbl:mri_deh}), previous studies have not: i) established baseline hydration status, ii) included a matched exercise-heat stress control trial, and iii) elicited a HYPO magnitude sufficient to markedly alter physiological status (${\ge}$2\% BM loss) \cite{cheuvront_biological_2010}. While most studies agree that total brain volume is not altered following HYPO \ref{tbl:mri_deh}, how individual brain structures are altered by body water deficits is not clear. Because intracellular HYPO results in a crenation of cellular volume, similar processes may occur in the brain. If water is removed from brain structures, this may explain increased ventricular volume following HYPO as has been observed previously \cite{kempton_dehydration_2011,kempton_effects_2009}. In this research aim, we instituted a protocol consisting of three experimental trials: a resting control and two exercise-heat stress bouts matched for duration and intensity, one with and one without fluid replacement. Following all experimental interventions, subjects were placed in a MRI scanner where brain anatomical scans were taken to determine the effects of hypohydration on individual brain structures, which has not been previously investigated. \textit{We hypothesize hypohydration will not alter total brain volume, will induce expansion of ventricular system while decreasing volume of the surrounding structures}. 

Furthermore, no study has systematically assessed the effects of HYPO on the visuomotor system, which governs many of the human-system interactions \cite{buhusi_what_2005} and therefore is directly applicable to many military and occupational scenarios. To assess visuomotor performance, we employed a visually paced unimanual finger tapping task (visuomotor pacing task, VMPT) requiring repeated button presses at regular and irregular intervals. Performance and brain function (via fMRI BOLD responses) during the VMPT were examined to explore possible hypohydration-mediated effects on the visuomotor system. Previous research has indicated elevated neural resources are required for cognitive-motor processing following HYPO even without performance impairments \cite{kempton_dehydration_2011}. Therefore, \textit{we hypothesize hypohydration will increase BOLD responses during visual paced finger tapping while not impairing task performance}. Secondly, in prolonged, monotonous cognitive-motor assessments, HYPO may result in increasing errors \cite{watson_mild_2015}. Therefore, \textit{we hypothesize hypohydration will elicit greater performance impairments over time during visual paced finger tapping}.

In Chapter 4, we address \textbf{Research Aim 3: To evaluate which phases of visuomotor processing (e.g., motor planning, motor execution) are impaired due to moderate hypohydration}. The VMPT was designed to minimize motor planning requirements, as the stimulus-response combinations were intentionally limited to one. To investigate motor planning, a paced choice reaction task (PCRT) will be implemented. The PCRT, like the VMPT, is visually paced but requires bimanual input and features weighted response frequencies between the left and right index fingers. The primary goal of the PCRT is to manipulate the amount of prior information which can influence motor planning \cite{wong_motor_2015}. The same experimental design as Aim 2 will be instituted, however, neural resources will be examined with EEG. EEG has superior temporal resolution to fMRI \cite{mehta_neuroergonomics:_2013} and therefore may help elucidate how hypohydration influences vsiuomotor timing. Specifically, this aim will investigate the visual-evoked potentials, which allows for investigations into a visual event (i.e., observing a stimulus) and the subsequent cognitive processing \cite{park_making_2015,huang_neurophysiology_2015}. The P300, occurring ${\sim}$300 ms after stimulus presentation, is associated with stimulus evaluation \cite{park_making_2015} and occurs frequency within choice reaction time tasks \cite{miller_motor_2001}. 

The amplitude and latency of the P300 can indicate mental workload and cognitive processing \cite{park_making_2015}. The P300 occurs within the central-parietal brain areas, and therefore this study will focus primarily on the parietal electrodes (i.e., P3, P4, Pz, Pza in the standard 10-20 system), as this indicates stimulus evaluation and planning stages following stimulus presentation. Although an auditory-evoked P300 was not different following HYPO \cite{szinnai_effect_2005}, visually-evoked stimuli do appear to increase neural resource requirement \cite{kempton_dehydration_2011,watson_mild_2015} following HYPO. Therefore, \textit{we hypothesize hypohydration will elicit both an increased amplitude and latent (as measured by time to achieve half-maximum amplitude) P300 in the parietal regions}. Although the PCRT has not been previously assessed following HYPO, choice reaction time task performance may not be affected by body water deficits \cite{danci_voluntary_2009} although perceptual discrimination may be impaired \cite{cian_effects_2001}. Therefore, \textit{we hypothesize hypohydration will increase reaction time difference between dominant and non-dominant weights compared to both control conditions}. 

Secondly, indices of mental workload (measured via the NASA-TLX scale) during the PCRT will help better understand the effect of hypohydration on perceived mental workload. Previous research has identified HYPO increases subjective mental workload during cognitive-motor tasks \cite{szinnai_effect_2005}, and therefore \textit{we hypothesize all components of the NASA-TLX will increase following HYPO compared to both control conditions}. With the PCRT, the greatest mental effort will be in perceiving and processing the stimulus. Therefore, if perceived mental workload occurs following HYPO, \textit{we hypothesize this will be positively associated with P300 amplitude.}
